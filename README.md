This GitHub repository is dedicated to storing documentation and source code for the prototype developed at Cortijo La Reina (Abecera, SL), funded by the PTQ2022-012681 grant from the Agencia Estatal de Investigación del Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación de España. This initiative supports industrial research and aims to foster the hiring of PhD-qualified personnel to enhance the professional development of researchers and stimulate demand for high-level expertise in private-sector R&D projects.

The CropCloudAnalytics prototype integrates crop simulation models and water-driven mechanisms with Wiseconn field sensors and Hispatec ERP. Its goal is to deliver a technical-economic assessment of crop growth, management, and financial control, focusing on crop expenses and projected income based on yield estimates and water consumption metrics.

In an era where resource efficiency is vital, the integration of monitoring and automation technologies in agriculture plays a crucial role in optimizing agricultural practices. Predictive agronomy combines agricultural expertise with historical data and real-time analytics, allowing for strategic decision-making. This innovative approach enhances efficiency and sustainability, addressing the challenges posed by a growing global population and resource scarcity.

The collaboration between technology companies, such as Wiseconn Ibérica and Abecera SL, aims to develop solutions that improve the value of predictive agronomy in Spanish irrigation systems. This partnership seeks to address the water scarcity crisis in Andalucía by creating advanced tools that help farmers make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and adapt to limited water resources.

Field trials for the project were conducted on crops like spinach and potatoes at the La Reina farm in Córdoba. Using Wiseconn’s DropControl, water application was monitored alongside soil moisture profiles and crop conditions, allowing for real-time estimations of biomass production. Data was collected and transmitted via API keys to the cloud for analysis, enabling a tailored solution for each farm's needs.

Preliminary results from the trials showed a promising degree of accuracy in estimating crop yields, particularly for spinach, where biomass levels were estimated with an error margin below 5%. For tuber yield estimates in the case of potatoes, the error margin ranged from 14% to 19%. The project resulted in the creation of CropCloudAnalytics, a digital advisory service that combines agronomic monitoring with financial tracking, providing real-time insights into crop management. This integrated approach not only enhances productivity and crop quality but also contributes to sustainable agricultural practices by optimizing resource use.
