Higher profitability, attaining sustainability, minimising workload, and economic development of the nation are the main driving forces for the adoption of smart farming technologies. Deep learning has emerged as an accurate tool for prediction and decision-making in smart farming. The integration of blockchain with deep learning is efficient in developing a secured data sharing framework. A crop disease data management framework that leverages the benefits of deep learning, blockchain, and interplanetary file system is proposed to assist farmers in crop disease detection and secure sharing of crop disease data. In the framework, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture-based banana crop disease detection module is included that achieves an accuracy of 99.91%. A system architecture based on blockchain for the crop disease communication module is included to ensure secured crop data sharing.

Faced with new technological developments, many risks and opportunities arise that need to be carefully translated into technological requirements to enable a sustainable production environment. Analyzing the complex relationship between social, ecological, and technological dependencies is a crucial step to understanding the different perspectives and systemic effects of technological functionalities. By providing a comprehensive overview of the state of the art, this article qualitatively analyzes the potential impact of AI on the autonomy of farmers and the technological developments to mitigate the risks. Fair data management practices, transparent AI approaches, and designs for an intuitive user experience are presented as key mechanisms for supporting responsible model development. Based on the defined social, technological, and ecological challenges in AI development, the knowledge to provide a high-level framework for the responsible creation of AI technologies is further systematized. By focusing on the multifaceted relationships and their effects on the autonomy of farmers, this article exemplifies the complex design decisions that must be faced in creating trustworthy and responsible AI tools. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; autonomous farming; Farming 4.0; requirement analysis; responsible AI; technology assessment","","","","","","","","Scown M.W., Winkler K.J., Nicholas K.A., Aligning research with policy and practice for sustainable agricultural land systems in Europe, Proc.

With the developments in big data technologies and their applications in the IoT realm, the analyzing, processing,, and handling streams of data and information are attaining the vast attention of researchers. In IoT, continuous information generation, handling and secure communication are achieved through innumerable devices. This information is enormous and time-varying. In all IoT applications processing, analyzing, and handling such information are extremely critical, as the ceaseless flow of information and time-sensitive decisions may make it inefficacious to process after storage. Therefore, processing such massive or streams of information must be executed in real-time. A better understanding of the stream data handling, analysis and communication aspect can help in effective data management. This review work provides the vitality of secure data stream handling and analysis in IoT applications. It explains the critical features and requirements of IoT data for the analysis and security concerns in industrial applications like smart city, smart agriculture and smart transportation system. It explores various studies emphasizing massive data management and the complexities involved with it. This article further investigates the different models and techniques utilized for handling IoT stream data in existing research works and enumerates their merits in stream data performance management. The review work also describes the technical challenges and research gap existing in-stream data handling and crucial further developments needed in this arena for effective management of IoT stream data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Big data; Big data analytics; Communication; Data processing; IoT; Security; Stream data; Stream data handling; Streaming data analytics","Data Analytics; Data streams; Digital storage; Information management; Internet of things; Big data analytic; Data analytics; Data stream handling; Security; Stream data; Stream data handling; Streaming data; Streaming data analytic; Big data","","","","","","","Wang L., Ranjan R., Processing distributed internet of things data in clouds, IEEE Cloud Computing, 2, 1, pp. 76-80, (2015); Gope P., Hwang T., BSN-care: A secure IoT-based modern healthcare system using body sensor network, IEEE Sensors Journal, 16, 5, pp. 1368-1376, (2015); Shah J.B., IoT enabled environmental monitoring system for smart cities, IEEE, City., (2016); Wei M., Hong S.H., Alam M., An IoT-based energy-management platform for industrial facilities, Applied energy, 164, pp. 607-619, (2016); Quadri S.A.I., Sathish P., IoT based home automation and surveillance system, IEEE, City, (2017); Mohanraj I., Ashokumar K., Naren J., Field monitoring and automation using IOT in agriculture domain, Procedia Computer Science, 93, pp. 931-939, (2016); Saarika P., Sandhya K., Sudha T., Smart transportation system using IoT, IEEE, City., (2017); Peddoju S.K.H., Evaluation of Iot Data Visualization Tools and Techniques., (2020); Guo Y., Rao J., Jiang C., Zhou X., Moving hadoop into the cloud with flexible slot management and speculative execution, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed systems, 28, 3, pp. 798-812, (2016); Goudarzi M., Heterogeneous architectures for big data batch processing in mapreduce paradigm, IEEE Transactions on Big Data, 5, 1, pp. 18-33, (2017); Mohammadi M., Al-Fuqaha A., Enabling cognitive smart cities using big data and machine learning: Approaches and challenges, IEEE Communications Magazine, 56, 2, pp. 94-101, (2018); Marjani M., Nasaruddin F., Gani A., Karim A., Hashem I.A.T., Siddiqa A., Yaqoob I., Big IoT data analytics: Architecture, opportunities, and open research challenges, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 5247-5261, (2017); Zaharia M., Chowdhury M., Das T., Dave A., Ma J., Mccauley M., Franklin M., Shenker S., Stoica I., Fast and interactive analytics over Hadoop data with Spark, Usenix Login, 37, 4, pp. 45-51, (2012); Engle C., Lupher A., Xin R., Zaharia M., Franklin M.J., Shenker S., Stoica I., Shark: Fast data analysis using coarse-grained distributed memory, City, (2012); Mohammadi M., Al-Fuqaha A., Sorour S., Guizani M., Deep learning for IoT big data and streaming analytics: A survey, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 20, 4, pp. 2923-2960, (2018); Alam F., Mehmood R., Katib I., Albogami N.N., Albeshri A., Data fusion and IoT for smart ubiquitous environments: A survey, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 9533-9554, (2017); Li B., Diao Y., Shenoy P., Supporting scalable analytics with latency constraints, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 8, 11, pp. 1166-1177, (2015); Stream Processing in Iot: Foundations, State-Of-The-Art, and Future Directions., (2016); Hilbert M., Big data for development: A review of promises and challenges, Development Policy Review, 34, 1, pp. 135-174, (2016); Hu H., Wen Y., Chua T.-S., Li X., Toward scalable systems for big data analytics: A technology tutorial, IEEE Access, 2, pp. 652-687, (2014); Strohbach M., Ziekow H., Gazis V.N., ).

Instantly, it is a current approach of handling distributed databases by a group of people. The purpose is to collect data, construct a digital ledger, and distribute it to each participant using P2P techniques. Blockchain technology gets employed in various industries, including government, transport, commerce, and healthcare. This paper will focus on using Blockchain in the agricultural supply chain, particularly the multi-Blockchain strategy for increasing performance and yield tracking. This type of architecture necessitates the presence of at least two chains in one system. This study will present a new theoretical architecture based on past investigations; the article examines how to adjust the approach and lists the many phases involved. The new framework will eliminate the mistakes that have plagued past studies. First, sensors get used to supply us with the recording data sets. We then store our data in blocks using the multi-Blockchain structure. Then, to control all transactions and make choices based on the criteria in the source code of these automated contracts, we create Smart Contracts. This technique should be more effective than cloud apps or simply storing data on a Blockchain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","agriculture; hash; information system; IoT; Multi-blockchain","Agriculture; Distributed ledger; Information management; Information systems; Internet of things; Supply chains; 'current; Agricultural fields; Agricultural supply chains; Block-chain; Distributed database; Hash; IoT; Multi-blockchain; P2P techniques; Performance; Blockchain","","","","","","","Dursun T., Ustundag B.B., A novel framework for policy based on-chain governance of blockchain networks, Inf.

However, despite the emergence of the concept of smart farming, the vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices remain largely underutilized due to a lack of effective data management systems. To fully exploit this data and take agriculture to the next level, it is crucial to implement a dedicated big data architecture that can capture and analyze data in real-time. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for managing big data in smart farming that is based on the data lake concept and the lambda architecture. Our proposed architecture aims to address the challenges of collecting, processing, and analyzing smart farming data in both batch and real-time modes. By combining smart farming and big data, our approach offers the possibility of real-time farm monitoring for agri-ecosystems stakeholders, which can help maximize productivity and quality while minimizing effort. Overall, our proposed architecture represents a significant step forward for smart farming and has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry. With the ability to capture and analyze data in real-time, our approach will enable farmers to make more informed decisions and optimize their operations for greater efficiency and profitability. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

Blockchain technology can enhance the transparency, traceability, and security of the supply chain. Traditional single-blockchain model faces the scalability limitations. Therefore, we propose multilayer blockchain system for agricultural data management to enable the precise management in various aspects, such as supply chain tracing, land management, market transactions, and sustainability tracking. Interplanetary file system helps to alleviate the burden on data storage. Based on the characteristics of system data flow, we devise a post-quantum cross-blockchain data exchange approach using attribute-based encryption (ABE-PQCBCDEA). It solves the scalability problem and realizes fine-grained access control of different blockchain data, and it significantly reduces the size of ciphertext sets for ciphertext reuse. ABE-PQCBCDEA obtains the 42.6&#x0025; improvement in the encryption and decryption efficiency compared with previous approaches, and its communication costs have been reduced by 48.5&#x0025;, thereby it reduces the burden of cross-chain data exchange.

The concepts of blockchain opportunities and incompleteness of agri-food chain projects based on blockchain technology are then explained, setting out the minimum and necessary characteristics required to make the use of this technology useful and effective (Minimum Viable Ecosystem). The process governance levels for the development and maintenance of a blockchain traceability project are then illustrated, focusing on the role and responsibility of each player in the supply chain. Finally, the structure of a blockchain solution is described, focusing on a number of structural and technological solutions by outlining the concepts of consistency checking for the validation of input data with appropriate smart contracts, and of information frameworks for the subsequent scrutiny of data in audit operations and the assignment of levels of reliability. These are essential prerequisites for a collaborative blockchain data management to pursue the objective of actual reliability and transparency of information.

The digital twin technology, which forms the core of such a digital transformation, provides benefits such as optimal operation and cost reduction by implementing the real world in a virtual space and analyzing, controlling, and simulating. Digital twins are now being applied to all industries, starting with manufacturing, city, energy, agriculture, and healthcare. As digital twins, which started in manufacturing, spread to all areas of the industry, interoperability is emerging as an important issue. To provide interoperability in digital twins, various global standards development organizations (SDOs) have come up with specifications related to the digital twin. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing standards for 5G, which can provide high-speed and reliable communication functions required for digital twins, and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OCG) manages geospatial information used in smart cities and other domains. ISO/TC 184 covers industrial data standards used in various domains such as manufacturing, industrial automation, and information systems. Furthermore, oneM2M, a global initiative to standardize a service layer IoT platform, defines common service functions for digital twins. In this chapter, in particular, ISO/TC 184 for industrial data in the smart factory field, ISO/IEEE for the digital health data, IEC TC65 for the interoperability in the smart factory, and oneM2M for service function for digital twin services are introduced. In addition, open-source activities in the domain of digital twins are gradually expanding in particular for digital twin platforms and data management. In addition to this, we look at several best practices of digital twins around the world. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","","","","","","","","Fuller Z., Fan C.D., Barlow C., Digital twin: Enabling technologies, chal-lenges and open research, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 108952-108971, (2020); He B., Bai K.J., Digital twin-based sustainable intelligent manufacturing: A review, Advances in Manufacturing, 9, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Sharma A., Kosasih E., Zhang J., Brintrup A., Calinescu A., Digital twins: State of the art theory and practice, challenges, and open research questions, (2020); Top 10 strategic technology trends for 2019: Digital Twins, (2019); Lee B.N., Pei E., Um J., An overview of information technology standardization activities related to additive manufacturing, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 4, pp. 345-354, (2019); Guodong S., Moneer H., Framework for a digital twin in manufacturing: Scope and requirements, Manufacturing Letters, 24, pp. 105-107, (2021); Automation systems and integration - Digital Twin framework for manu-facturing - Part 1: Overview and general principles; Automation systems and integration - Digital Twin framework for manu-facturing - Part 2: Reference architecture; Automation systems and integration - Digital Twin framework for manu-facturing - Part 3: Digital representation of physical manufacturing elements; Automation systems and integration - Digital Twin framework for manu-facturing - Part 4: Information exchange; Laamarti F., Badawi H.F., Ding Y., Arafsha F., Hafidh B., Saddik A.E., An ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized Digital Twin framework for health and well-being in smart cities, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 105950-105961, (2020); Gamez Diaz R., Yu Q., Ding Y., Laamarti F., El Saddik A., Digital twin coaching for physical activities: A survey, Sensors, 20, (2020); Badawi H.F., Laamarti F., El Saddik A., ISO/IEEE11073 personal health device (X73-PHD) standards compliant systems: A systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 3062-3073, (2019); Santos D.F.S., Almeida H.O., Perkusich A., A personal connected health system for the Internet of Things based on the constrained application protocol, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 44, pp. 122-136; Talaminos A., Naranjo D., Barbarov G., Roa L.M., Reina-Tosina J., Design and imple-mentation of a standardised framework for the management of a wireless body network in an mobile health environment, Healthcare Technology Letters, 4, 3, pp. 88-92; Villagran N.V., Estevez E., Pesado P., Marquez J.D.J., Standardization: A key factor of Industry 4.0, 2019 Sixth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG), pp. 350-354, (2019); Schweichhart K., An introduction, 40; Han S., A review of smart manufacturing reference models based on the skeleton meta-model, Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, 7, 3, pp. 323-336, (2020); ISO Standard, (2011); IEC Standard (parts updated in 2011), (2011); Swetina J., Lu G., Jacobs P., Ennesser F., Song J., Toward a standardized com-mon M2M service layer platform: Introduction to oneM2M, IEEE Wireless Communications, 21, 3, pp. 20-26, (2014); Viola F., Antoniazzi F., Aguzzi C., Kamienski C., Roffia L., Mapping the NGSI-LD context model on top of a SPARQL event processing architecture: Implementation guidelines, 2019 24th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT), pp. 493-501, (2019); Lohr S., G.E., the 124-year-old software start-up, New York Times, (2016); Morris D.H., Et al., A software platform for operational technology innovation, International Data Corporation, pp. 1-17, (2014); DHL supply chain partners tetra Pak to implement its first Digital Twin warehouse in Asia Pacific","J.

In most of the world's rural areas, where farming takes place, network coverage and infrastructure is at a basic level. However, where digital farming solutions are applied, internet-dependent applications need backup solutions to enable the same or a comparable performance towards maintaining the functionality of the specific practice and ultimately food production. The aim is to avoid regressing to basic practices waiving advantages of established precision farming technologies. Based on a conceptual framework, defined by the authors in a previous work, site-specific slurry application was chosen as a concrete use case to implement and demonstrate fallback options to maintain efficient and reliable application even during internet outages. Initially, the differences between conventional and resilient IT infrastructure were contrasted and investigated. The generation of a prescription map (PM) based on the fusion of multiple parameters, clustered in the domains of soil, yield, and remote sensing, was performed utilizing open-source and offline usable software. For seamless transmission of the generated PMs, a new and innovative hardware platform was integrated into the machinery fleet and working process of a machinery ring (MR), which was acting as a service contractor in the inter-farm slurry application. Interoperability was considered by enabling the executing software to accept PMs of altering origin. The on- and off-line generation of PMs including data fusion, were also compared. Here the multi-parametric approach corresponded to the ground truth data, whereas the PMs generated in an online farm management information system (FMIS), using only one data source, showed deviations in management zone patterns and relative dose rates. In addition, the impact of the lack of online accessible data on the delineation of management zones was investigated and resulted in a switch from the medium to the high dose rate (DR) level in 9.1% of the field's area. © 2023","Clustered data fusion; On-/Offline precision farming; Open source prescription map generation; Resilient data management; Site-specific slurry application","","","","","","EIP-AGRI; Nevonex team; European Commission, EC","The present study was carried out as part of the MR digital project, a project under the EIP-AGRI funding measure of the European Union.

Western Visayas, along with the other regions of the Philippines, has committed to participate in national efforts to strengthen the production capacity of the cacao industry and address prospects and opportunities for the industry growth and development. This paper presents the results of a region-wide study that mapped out and assessed key cacao-producing areas in the Western Visayas, specifically Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo. The study sought their current production levels, important agricultural properties of farming areas, production densities, and growth potentials. Geospatial data was generated, analyzed, and mapped using Open Data Kit (ODK), an electronic data management system. Findings revealed that cacao plantations are not evenly distributed in Panay Island. Most cacao farms are located in the Province of Iloilo; however, tree density was highest at farms in the Province of Capiz. The geophysical characteristics of most cocoa-producing areas were consistent with the geophysical elements mentioned in the literature. These findings can be used for science-based decisions for promoting the emerging cacao industry in Panay Island. © 2023, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

This can be achieved by the introduction of technology for efficiency and the improvement of the genetic merit of animals. A fundamental requirement for animal breeding is the availability of accurate and reliable pedigreed data and tools facilitating sophisticated computations. Keeping this in view, Smart Sheep Breeder (SSB) was developed using the waterfall methodology and multiple programming languages. It is a multi-use online artificial intelligence (AI) based and internet of things (IoT) compatible decision support system (DSS). It is capable of automatic performance recording, farm data management, data mining, biometrical analysis, e-governance, and decision-making in sheep farms. A centralized database was also developed capable of ranking sheep across multiple farms based on genetic merit and effective dissemination of germplasm. The system in India is available as a web-based tool and android application which facilitates performance recording and generates customized reports on various aspects of sheep production. SSB uses artificial intelligence and biometrical genetic algorithms to calculate breeding values, and inbreeding coefficients, construct selection indices and generate pedigree, and history sheets as well as more than 40 types of custom-tailored animal and farm reports and graphs. The algorithms used were validated using on farms using farm data and also by comparison with established methods and software. Smart Sheep Breeder could thus prove to be indispensable for the present farming systems which could be used by sheep farm managers and breeders across India. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Inbreeding; India; Pedigree; Sheep; animal; artificial intelligence; genetics; inbreeding; India; pedigree; sheep","","","","","","","Hamadani A., Ganai N.A., Khan N.N., Shanaz S., Ahmad T., Estimation of genetic, heritability, and phenotypic trends for weight and wool traits in Rambouillet sheep, Small Rumin.

About 60% of the net sown area is under rainfed agriculture, and this makes India vulnerable to climate change considerably affecting the cropping system, livestock, and soil and increasing pests and diseases. Climate change would have a serious impact on Indian agriculture in the coming years which would negatively impact some important crops leading to food insecurity. The present trend and scenario are evident that without an efficient measure, it would be very difficult to meet agro-demand of the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need of efficient measures of adaption and mitigation. Therefore, smart agriculture using IoT (Internet of Things) technology has opened up extremely productive ways for farmers, helps in managing agricultural systems, and deals with weather uncertainties and challenges improving resource management. It enables farmers to collect real-time data related to weather updates, irrigation, production, yield quality, and soil moisture and predict pest, diseases, and market information and strengthen good agricultural practices in farms. Additionally, IoT solutions along with smart practices in agriculture offer opportunities for innovation in climate adaptation reducing the ecological footprints and enhancing the livelihoods of farmers. Thus, the present paper aims to review the current and future trends of IoT in the Indian agriculture system, highlighting potential challenges and also its role in combating climate change. Additionally, the study recommends adoption of good agricultural practices, capacity building, and switching from traditional to precise farming with IoT-based technology. For future scope, institutional innovations, networking of farmers, regulatory authorities, clear policies supporting the necessary legal and market architecture for smart farming, and transparent data management system will be required. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Internet of Things; Livelihood; Smart agriculture","","","","","","","","Adamides G., Kalatzis N., Stylianou A., Marianos N., Chatzipapadopoulos F., Giannakopoulou M., Neocleous D., Smart farming techniques for climate change adaptation in Cyprus, Atmosphere, 11, 6, (2020); Alreshidi E., Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA) Solution Underpinned by Internet of Things (Iot) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Digital twins have been applied to various fields, including to the agricultural field. Given big data and systematic data management, digital twins can be used for predicting future outcomes. In this study, we endeavor to create an agricultural digital twin using mandarins as a model crop. We employ an Open API to aggregate data from various sources across Jeju Island, covering an area of approximately 185,000 hectares. The collected data are visualized and analyzed at regional, inter-orchard, and intra-orchard scales. We observe that the intra-orchard analysis explains the variation of fruit quality substantially more than the inter-orchard analysis. Our data visualization and analysis, incorporating statistical models and machine learning algorithms, demonstrate the potential use of agricultural digital twins in the future, particularly in the context of micro-precision and individualized agriculture. This concept extends the current management practices based on data-driven decisions, and it offers a glimpse into the future of individualized agriculture by enabling customized treatment for plants, akin to personalized medicine for humans. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Agriculture; Algorithms; Big Data; Data Collection; Humans; Technology; Cheju [Cheju (PRVISL)]; advanced technology; alternative agriculture; data set; digitization; fruit; fruit production; machine learning; agriculture; article; big data; data visualization; digital twin; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; mandarin; orchard; personalized medicine; statistical model; algorithm; information processing; technology","","","","","NSDIP; Joslin Diabetes Center, JDC; Jeju National University, JNU; Rural Development Administration, RDA; Ministry of the Interior and Safety, MOIS","We thank Professor Yong Suk Chung (Jeju National University) who provided valuable expertise and input for this research and paper.

Farmers are required to finish their spraying with high efficiency due to constraints in cost and time. Nevertheless, farmers need more knowledge and information required for managing Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV) spraying and providing the conditions of their fields because both data (management and field conditions) affect capacity. The field capacitance model was generated from UAV spraying (Tiger Drone) on a sugarcane field. Consequently, this research intended to discover the prediction model for effective field capacity for UAV spraying (Tiger Drone) in the sugarcane field. The procedure began by collecting the data of nine UAVs spraying in the sugarcane fields, for example, field, crop, UAV condition, and working times, to develop the prediction model for the UAV spraying in the sugarcane field. The prediction model was then validated using nine sugarcane fields collected correspondingly to the model’s output. The conclusion presented was that the model’s root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.14 m²/s. Farmers and providers can apply a predictive model to manage the spraying process and provide their field conditions. © 2023, Khon Kaen University,Research and Technology Transfer Affairs Division.

But the adoption of digital technologies has arguably created new or exacerbated existing socioeconomic disparities, while raising ethical issues, particularly when considering technology access and adoption. So far, the literature has placed little emphasis on how to effectively bridge knowledge and skills disparities in the agriculture sector—or mend agriculture's ‘digital divides’—through workforce development strategies that leverage higher education and extension programs. In this article, we argue that academic programs have a much bigger role to play via educational and extension efforts to equip tomorrow's AI-ready workforce. This may be accomplished through imparting technological know-how in the form of upskilling and reskilling, and through the strategic management of equitable technological change and incorporation of ethical data management. We explain what this upskilling should consist in, where it is needed the most, and why engaging with the ethics of emerging technologies is important. The reader will get an appreciation of how academic programs can leverage digital agriculture (DA) to develop skills and talent needed for the agricultural sector to reap the benefits of digitalization and address the workforce development challenges encountered. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","AI ethics; Digital agriculture; Disparities; Higher education; Workforce development","E-learning; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Philosophical aspects; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; Academic program; Agricultural sector; Artificial intelligence ethic; Digital agriculture; Digital divide; Digital technologies; Disparity; High educations; Socio-economics; Workforce development; agricultural technology; artificial intelligence; computer vision; digitization; higher education; Internet; planning method; socioeconomic conditions; technological change; technology adoption; Agriculture","","","","","U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA; Louisiana Board of Regents, LBR, (2023-26, RD-A-01); Louisiana Board of Regents, LBR","Funding text 1: This research was supported in part by the intramural research program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture Multistate S1090 AI in Agroecosystems: Big Data and Smart Technology-Driven Sustainable Production; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge LSU's Center for Collaborative Knowledge (CCK) for sponsoring the research group in AI, Ethics and Automation in Agriculture.

However, in the underdeveloped ethnic regions of western China, does digitization represent a valuable opportunity or a serious challenge? In this article, Litang County, Sichuan Province, located in the western high plateau region, was taken as an example, and text analysis of multi-source data was performed, including of policy documents, planning texts, website information of agricultural companies and government departments, and materials based on semi-structured interviews with local authorities and leading agricultural companies, with the purpose of discussing the dynamic mechanism of agricultural digitization in underdeveloped western counties. It was found that agricultural digitization in Litang has the following three typical characteristics: 1) full-chain digitization, that is, a closed-loop structure of data is formed through enterprise data centers, local data management platforms, and e-commerce platforms from various links such as vegetable and fruit breeding, planting, condensation logistics, and product sales; 2) multi-agent promotion, that is, agricultural companies, retailers, government departments and their agents, as well as social organizations, cooperate and promote each other in agricultural digital infrastructure construction, data technology application and data management, and agricultural resources integration; 3) coordination within and outside the county, namely timely response to the national rural revitalization strategy, corresponding poverty alleviation policies and local planning goals and action plans, coordination between the matching aid units and local departments and institutions in terms of the dual goals of economic benefits and poverty alleviation, and coordination between agricultural companies, social organizations, platform institutions and farmers, and other stakeholders within and outside the county. This study contributes to the establishment of a four-dimensional analysis framework of natural environment-market-institution-technology based on the institutional analysis of economic geography and enriches the research on economic geography in the field of agricultural digitalization. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the special natural environment in the high plateau area has shaped the constraint conditions and advantages of agricultural development in Litang, which encourages local companies to adopt a differentiation strategy, enter outside segment markets, and create a new evolutionary path using biological and digital technology. Second, the application of digital technology is not only beneficial to meet the needs of remote consumers for production information but also to provide feedback on timely changes in market demand for local agricultural companies, which is conducive to the adjustment and optimization of the decisions of agricultural producers. Technology investment increases production costs, which can be achieved by entering middle- and high-end markets to increase revenue. Third, the digital transformation of leader companies is not only the result of responding to or embedding national and local agricultural digitization strategies, but also puts forward potential requirements for the adjustment and optimization of local institutions and production organizations. Government and leadership companies jointly promote agricultural digitalization. In addition, the national matching poverty alleviation policy enables local governments to obtain scarce resources such as technology, capital, and market opportunities through external support, effectively reducing the risks and costs of digital transformation for leader companies, farmers, and other local production actors and promoting the spatial agglomeration of digital elements and resources through the external economies of the production network.

These strategies consider data as the backbone, allowing advanced data analytics. However, in the agricultural field, and especially in fish farming, data-driven strategies have yet to be widely adopted. This research paper aims to demystify the situation of the fish farming domain in general by shedding light on big data generated in fish farms. The purpose is to propose a dedicated data lake functional architecture and extend it to a technical architecture to initiate a fish farming data-driven strategy. The research opted for an exploratory study to explore the existing big data technologies and to propose an architecture applicable to the fish farming data-driven strategy. The paper provides a review of how big data technologies offer multiple advantages for decision making and enabling prediction use cases. It also highlights different big data technologies and their use. Finally, the paper presents the proposed architecture to initiate a data-driven strategy in the fish farming domain. © 2023 by the authors.","big data; data analytics; data lake; data-driven strategy; fish farming","","","","","","","","Sawant N., Himanshu S., Big data application architecture, Big data Application Architecture Q & A, pp. 9-28, (2013); Nachiappan R., Javadi B., Calheiros R.N., Matawie K.M., Cloud storage reliability for Big Data applications: A state of the art survey, J.

The whole-farm nutrient mass balance (NMB) is an assessment with an associated DST (the Cornell NMB calculator) that measures farm nutrient management efficiency. Our main objectives were to (1) develop and implement a secondary school curriculum on NMB assessments; (2) evaluate its impact on student knowledge and perceptions of agricultural sustainability, nutrient management, careers in agriculture, awareness about data collection and use of DSTs, and analytical and quantitative skills; and (3) assess teacher experiences delivering the materials. The curriculum was implemented across 21 New York classrooms. Students completed one pre- and one post-curriculum implementation questionnaire (n = 134). Teachers completed a post-curriculum implementation questionnaire (n = 19). Results showed that the curriculum enhanced student knowledge of nutrient management and effectively conveyed the fundamentals of the NMB metrics. It also impacted student perceptions of the utilization of DSTs and need for mathematical skills and data management knowledge in agriculture. The curriculum did not influence student interest in pursuing agricultural careers but exposed them to aspects of farming that they were not previously familiar with. The math-focused lessons were identified as challenging by many students and teachers. Teachers found the curriculum applicable to the real world, exposing students to new aspects of farming. We conclude that real-world case-study examples, carefully planned math-focused lessons, appropriate support materials including widely installable and user-friendly software, and training opportunities for teachers can help effective teaching of DST use and agriculture sustainability concepts. © 2024 The Authors.

This integration aims to enhance sustainable agricultural practices, using rice cultivation as a case study of high relevance and reapplicability given its importance in the food chain and the high irrigation requirement of its cultivation. The approach employs sensor-based intelligent irrigation systems to optimize water efficiency. These systems enable real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters through IoT sensors. Data management is facilitated by IOTA’s Tangle, providing secure and efficient data handling, and integrated with MongoDB, a Database Management System (DBMS), for effective data storage and retrieval. The collaboration between IoT and IOTA led to significant reductions in resource consumption. Implementing sustainable agricultural practices resulted in a 50% reduction in water usage, 25% decrease in nitrogen consumption, and a 50% to 70% reduction in methane emissions. Additionally, the system contributed to lower electricity consumption for irrigation pumps and generated comprehensive historical water depth records, aiding future resource management decisions. This study concludes that the integration of IoT with IOTA’s Tangle presents a highly promising solution for advancing sustainable agriculture. This approach significantly contributes to environmental conservation and food security. Furthermore, it establishes that DLTs like IOTA are not only viable but also effective for real-time monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. © 2023 by the authors.","agrifood sector; distributed ledger technologies (DLT); environmental footprint; internet of things (IoT); IOTA tangle; real-time data recording; rice cultivation; sustainability","","","","","","Institute of BioMed-IT, Energy-IT and Smart-IT Technology (Best), Yonsei University; European Commission, EC; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2020LMWF9Y); research and innovation infrastructures, (IR0000033)","This study was partially funded through the NPRR project METROFOODIT and the PRIN project WE_BEST (Italian Ministry of University and Research, 2020 call, PROT. 2020LMWF9Y).

In this sector, traditionally large amounts of data are acquired, but not well-managed and -analyzed as a basis for evidence-based decision-making processes. Here, we present a comprehensive step-by-step guide that explores the use of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data within rice production systems under tropical conditions. Our work focuses on using the multi-temporal dataset associated with the monitoring of diseases and climate variables in rice in Colombia during eight years (2012–2019). The study comprises four main phases: (I) data cleaning and organization to ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset; (II) data management involving web-scraping techniques to acquire climate information from free databases, like WordClim and Chelsa, validation against in situ weather stations, and bias removal to enrich the dataset; (III) data visualization techniques to effectively represent the gathered information, and (IV) a basic analysis related to the clustering and climatic characterization of rice-producing areas in Colombia. In our work, a process of evaluation and the validation of climate data are conducted based on errors (r, R2, MAE, RSME) and bias evaluation metrics. In addition, in phase II, climate clustering was conducted based on a PCA and K-means algorithm. Understanding the association of climatic and epidemiological data is pivotal in predicting and mitigating disease outbreaks in rice production areas. Our research underscores the significance of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data for rice production systems.

It involves the acquisition of multicompound heterogeneous agricultural resource data, changing their pattern and structure, classifying them, coding then saving them in a three ranks military band agriculture resources database. By putting up an agricultural resource data acquisition and sharing model, this approach seeks to enable key agriculturists details being integrated within one management platform for effective utilization, cost savings, centralised updates and maintenance, improved data quality as well as enhanced sharing. In view of these and other problems such as fragmentation, lack of mobility, inadequate sharing, poor quality of information, data under-utilization, delayed release of information etc., this method contributes to the best use and development of the agricultural resource information.  © 2024 IEEE.","Agri-data management; Internet of Things (IoT); Smart Agriculture","Agricultural technology; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Data fusion; Data integration; Internet of things; Natural resources; Agri-data management; Agricultural resources; Fusion technology; Heterogeneous data; Information sharing; Internet of thing; Resource database; Resources integrations; Smart agricultures; Standard system; Information management","","","","","","","Friha O., Ferrag M.A., Shu L., Maglaras L., Wang X., Internet of Things for the Future of Smart Agriculture: A Comprehensive Survey of Emerging Technologies, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 8, 4, pp. 718-752, (2021); Pamuklu T., Nguyen A.C., Syed A., Kennedy W.S., Erol-Kantarci M., IoT-Aerial Base Station Task Offloading With Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning for Smart Agriculture, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 7, 1, pp. 171-182, (2023); Pagano A., Croce D., Tinnirello I., Vitale G., A Survey on LoRa for Smart Agriculture: Current Trends and Future Perspectives, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 4, pp. 3664-3679, (2023); Misra N.N., Dixit Y., Al-Mallahi A., Bhullar M.S., Upadhyay R., Martynenko A., IoT, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture and Food Industry, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 9, pp. 6305-6324, (2022); Saha R., Chakraborty A., Misra S., Das S.K., Chatterjee C., DLSense: Distributed Learning-Based Smart Virtual Sensing for Precision Agriculture, IEEE Sensors Journal, 21, 16, pp. 17556-17563, (2021); Vicente-Guijalba, Martinez-Marin T., Lopez-Sanchez J.M., Dynamical Approach for Real-Time Monitoring of Agricultural Crops, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 53, 6, pp. 3278-3293, (2015); Farooq M.S., Riaz S., Helou M.A., Khan F.S., Abid A., Alvi A., Internet of Things in Greenhouse Agriculture: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Applications, and Protocols, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 53374-53397; Ranganathan V., Kumar P., Kaur U., Li S.H.Q., Chakraborty T., Chandra R., Re-Inventing the Food Supply Chain with IoT: A Data-Driven Solution to Reduce Food Loss, IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 5, 1, pp. 41-47; Sharma D.S., Green biocomposites: A prospective utilization in automobile industry, Green Energy and Technology, pp. 167-191, (2017); Zhang Q., Chen D., Mahajan Y., Chen I.-R., Ha D.S., Cho J.-H., Attack-Resistant, Energy-Adaptive Monitoring for Smart Farms: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach, IEEE Internet of Things Journal; Chaudhary P., Et al., Application of Synthetic Consortia for Improvement of Soil Fertility, Pollution Remediation, and Agricultural Productivity: A Review, Agronomy, 13, 3, (2023); Nikhil M., Protected Cultivation of Underutilized Vegetables, (2023); Paul J., Et al., Potato production through bio-resources: Long-term effects on tuber productivity, quality, carbon sequestration and soil health in temperate Himalayas, Scientia Horticulturae, (2016); Singh S.K., Et al., Progress and potential of biofertilization in contemporary production practices of sustainable agriculture: Review, Annals of Biology, 34, pp. 196-201; Rai S., Et al., Research in Agrometeorolgy on Fodder Crops in Central India-An Overview, Atmospheric and Climate Sciences., 4, pp. 78-91, (2014)","V.

Precision farming, improved crop management, and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices are just a few of the ways in which cloud computing technologies are transforming the agricultural sector. Farmers are given an opportunity to make data-driven decisions and enhance resource usage, thanks to the scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud-based solutions. In addition, cloud computing has several uses in smart farming, such as remote control of farming processes, real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and data collecting from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Cloud platforms have the ability to facilitate the collection and dissemination of data across ecosystem participants, hence promoting cooperation and the spread of knowledge in the agriculture sector.

This approach aims to empower agricultural systems operating in nature-dependent conditions, enabling them to optimize the utilization of limited resources effectively. This study aimed to provide the agricultural data management needed for the adoption of sustainable agriculture systems and the transition of precision to smart agriculture systems by combining technology. The study was carried out in the 2019–2020 vegetation period to determine the effect of the parameters on the yield in the areas where organic farming is grown in Isparta oil rose (Rosa Damascena Mill.) and to develop yield prediction models by combining them with spectral measurements. In the study, the phenological, morphological, and biochemical changes of the Isparta oil rose were examined periodically, and the effects of biotic and abiotic stress factors during the vegetation period were determined in the study and testing area. For the early yield prediction of organic Isparta oil rose was chosen thirteen parameters as soil moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil temperature, and nine vegetation indices were derived from UAV-acquired multispectral images. The parameters were functioned in machine learning algorithms, which were multiple linear regression (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), decision trees (chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID), exhaustive chi-squared automatic interaction detector (ExCHAID), classification and regression tree (CART)), random forest (RF)) and artificial neural network (ANN), to develop the prediction models. Early period (day 69) for organic rose yield prediction models were determined to be useable as MARS 1 (0.907 R2), ExCHAID 1 (0.888 R2), CART 1 (0.931 R2), and RF 1 (0.909 R2). As a result of the study, the models can be used integrated with UAV and soil data for the early prediction of Isparta oil rose yield under organic farming systems, especially during the Agriculture 4.0 transition phase in our country. It is such that models be developed and used in different ecologies for sustainable agricultural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Isparta oil rose; Machine learning algorithms; Organic farming; UAVs; Yield prediction","","","","","","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","This study is based on data obtained from the project with the reference number TOVAG 120 O 166, generously supported by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye) .

AIoT seeks to improve data management and analytics, increase human-machine interactions, and streamline IoT operations. The IoT is an interconnected system of computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, and items that may send data over a network without requiring human or computer-to-human interaction. Any device that can be assigned an Internet Protocol address and communicate data across a network is considered an IoT item. Examples include an implanted heart monitor or a car with built-in sensors that alert the driver when the tyre pressure is small. As AI enhances IoT through connectivity, signaling, and data exchange while IoT enhances AI through machine learning capabilities and enhanced decision-making processes, AIoT is a game-changer and mutually beneficial technology for both types of technology. The IoT may look up businesses and their services by adding value to the data they produce. Using AI, the IoT device may assess, learn from, and make judgments without the assistance of a human. The current chapter presents two new approaches towards the AIoT and IoT applications: AIoT-based water management system and IoT-based smart irrigation system which are very successful in smart agriculture system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2022.

For task automation, machine learning and expert systems are of primary importance to study the behavior of computer thinking to involve computers in sensible work, known as “computational intelligence.” The data involves varied formats such as structured, unstructured, as well as semi-structured, and it is an automation tool that uses computational intelligence to extract valid and potential information from the sources. The specific purpose of this proposed work is to meet out computing demands which highly rely on computational intelligence. Computational intelligence involves the design and deployment of an analytical tool for multidimensional data analytics. The proposed integrated framework focuses on multidimensional data analytics, for crop and plant data, especially plants that contain medicinal values and components. This research work’s main aim is to create a secured data tool for agriculture crop data management through big data (crops and plants) analytics. The data security is enhanced through applied cryptography, and the final phase prediction on crops is done by various machine and deep learning algorithms. The specific objective of this research work is to help farmers in making informed decisions for the enhancement of cultivation and information. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."," Computation simulation;  Multidimensional data;  Smart agricultural system;  Smart agriculture;  Smart IoT; Computational intelligence","Automation; Big data; Cultivation; Data Analytics; Deep learning; Expert systems; Information management; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Advisory systems; Agricultural system; Analytical tool; Automation tools; Computation simulation; Data analytics; Multidimensional data; Smart agricultural system; Smart agricultures; Smart IoT; Crops","","","","","","","Ayaz M., Et al., Internet-of-Things (IoT) based smart agriculture: Towards making the fields talk, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Channe H., Kothari S., Kadam D., Multidisciplinary model for smart agriculture using internet-of-things (IoT), sensors, cloud-computing, mobile-computing & big-data analysis, Int.

Rates of insect data generation, aggregation, and interpretation are increasing on many fronts, with rapid growth in data volumes, methods of data collection, and new analytical and computational approaches. Insects represent the most diverse group of species at planet earth, accounting for over 50% of known organisms. Their close interaction with human and other life forms has significant impacts on human health, environments, agriculture, biosafety, etc. Thus, entomology has been a hot research topic for worldwide scientists for long time. The mass extinction of species diversity and abundance have substantial taxonomic, spatial, and temporal biases and gaps. The lack of data holds especially true for insects despite the fact that they represent the vast majority of animal species. A major reason for these shortfalls for insects and other invertebrates is that available methods to study and monitor species and their population trends are antiquated and inefficient. Nevertheless, some recent studies have demonstrated alarming rates of insect diversity and abundance loss. To further explore the extent and causes of these changes, we need efficient, rigorous, and reliable methods to study and monitor insects. The development of modern biology, such as molecular biology, cell biology, and genetics, integrates new elements and concepts into the classical entomology. Now, over ten insect genomes have been sequenced. These data, plus the novel tools and thoughts, provide tremendous amounts of information for entomological researchers to deeply and systematically study insects. Entomological big-data systems include in situ and remote sensors, community data resources, biodiversity databases, citizen science, and permanent stations. Technological solutions include the development of open code and data-sharing platforms, flexible statistical models that can handle heterogeneous data and sources of uncertainty, and cloud-computing delivery of high-velocity computing to large-volume analytics. © 2025 Apple Academic Press, Inc.

Much touted as an environmentally beneficial technology with the ability to improve data management and reduce the use of chemical inputs while improving yields and addressing labour shortages, agricultural robotics also presents a number of potential ethical challenges – including rural unemployment, the amplification of economic and digital inequalities, and entrenching unsustainable farming practices. As such, development is not uncontroversial, and there have been calls for a responsible approach to their innovation that integrates more substantive inclusion into development processes. This study investigates current approaches to participation and inclusion amongst United Kingdom (UK) agricultural robotics developers. Through semi-structured interviews with key members of the UK agricultural robotics sector, we analyse the stakeholder engagement currently integrated into development processes. We explore who is included, how inclusion is done, and what the inclusion is done for. We reflect on how these findings align with the current literature on stakeholder inclusion in agricultural technology development, and suggest what they could mean for the development of more substantive responsible innovation in agricultural robotics. © The Author(s) 2024.","Agricultural robotics; Emerging technology ethics; Participation; Responsible innovation; Stakeholder inclusion","","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (BB/T008776/1)","Kirsten Ayris is funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) doctoral training grant no: BB/T008776/1.

The value of data is however not only in its collection and storage, but largely in its re-use. Big data storage repositories are not enough when we consider a world brimming with escalating volumes of data, here we need to consider innovative systems and tools which address data harmonization and standardization and importantly, ones that can bridge the gap between science and end users. In this paper, we will demonstrate how CGIAR (including the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT) develops a culture of co-operation and collaboration among custodians of agrobiodiversity data, as well as new directions for big data. CGIAR first launched the Platform for Big Data in Agriculture to enhance the development and maintenance of its data. This helped establish workflows of cross-platform synthesis, annotate and apply the lessons learnt. The Platform then built GARDIAN (Global Agricultural Research Data Innovation and Acceleration Network)—a digital tool that harvests from ∼40 separate open data and publication repositories that 15 CGIAR centres have used for data synthesis. While there have been significant advances in big data management and storage, we also identify the gaps to improve use, and the re-use of data in order to reveal its added value in decision making.

The SM Operational Products System (SMOPS) was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to operationally provide an integrated satellite SM data product. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM retrieval is an important component of the currently operational SMOPS. This study is proposed to refine the AMSR2 data product using an optimal machine-learning model, and this first paper of the two-part series is to intercompare the six commonly used machine-learning models including multiple linear regression (MLR), regression tree (RRT), random forest (RFT), gradient boosting (GBR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN). Results indicate that all of the six approaches can preserve the reference data information beyond the training time period, which ensures they predict past and future satellite retrievals without a new training procedure. Relative to other models, the XGB method is more successful to respect to the reference data SM Active Passive (SMAP) and the in situ observations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). It has a good implication for the implementation of the XGB model to refine the AMSR2 SM retrievals in the second paper.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) soil moisture (SM); machine learning; SM Operational Products System (SMOPS)","Adaptive boosting; Climate models; Forestry; Information services; Learning systems; Linear regression; Neural networks; Satellites; Soil surveys; Surface waters; AMSR-2 soil moisture; Land surface; Machine-learning; Microwave radiometry; Ocean temperature; Operational products; Product systems; Satellite broadcasting; Sea surfaces; Soil moisture operational product system; AMSR-E; data management; machine learning; pattern recognition; remote sensing; soil moisture; Soil moisture","","","","","JPSS; NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, (NA19NES4320002); Climate Program Office, CPO","This work was jointly supported in part by the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)-Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, in part by the NOAA Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Program, in part by the NOAA Climate Program Office (CPO)-Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) Program, and in part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under Grant NA19NES4320002.","Seneviratne S.I., Et al., Investigating soil moisture-climate interactions in a changing climate: A review, Earth-Sci.

Broiler chickens account for 67% of the meat produced by poultry farming, local/free-range chickens account for 23% and the remaining flesh comes from various varieties of poultry. Bali's poultry farmers' business management becomes unproductive and inefficient since not all of them employ information technology to manage their business procedures. The aim of this research was to ascertain how interested and likely Bali's poultry farmers were to use the Agree PT XYZ program as a form of information technology. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) paradigm served as the foundation for the research approach in this study. In order to gather study data, questionnaires were given out to respondents in five Bali districts. The partial least squares structural equation model is employed for data management. According to the study's findings, use behavior is directly, favorably, and significantly influenced by social influence and performance expectations. Useful and positive conduct is directly influenced by behavior purpose. This research can provide recommendations for software developers that the factors that influence behavior intention are performance expectancy and social influence. Farmers are interested in using the agree application due to expectations of performance and the influence of the social environment. Supporting facilities are not too concerned by breeders because the condition of internet facilities is not a problem at their location and breeders think that technological changes are inevitable in the era of change and must be applied to the breeder's business process. © 2023 IEEE.","Behavior Intention; Poultry Farmers; Technology Adoption; UTAUT","Animals; Farms; Information management; Least squares approximations; Behaviour intentions; Broiler chickens; Business management; Business procedures; Indonesia; Poultry farmer; Social influence; Technology adoption; Technology advancement; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Lau S.E.N., Et al., Review: Identification of roadmap of fourth construction industrial revolution, IOP Conf.

Data collected during animal husbandry and slaughter are used as raw material for this improvement. These process data are not only presented in tabular form and charts but also form the basis for extracting causal relationships between husbandry decisions and animal health diagnosed at the slaughterhouse. These causal reltionships are represented by a statistical model. This knowledge thus represents a tangible and monetary asset for optimizing production processes in the manufacture of meat, the use of which must be monitored and incentivized. PigConomy illustrates with a proof of concept the monetization of data from the process chain for the production of pork. However, not only the economic optimization of husbandry processes is in the foreground, but also the improvement of animal welfare, as it is quantitatively determined at the slaughterhouse. Animal welfare can be improved by using the knowledge of the causal relationships between husbandry decisions and animal health, analogous to husbandry efficiency. This contribution describes PigConomy as the core of a data management ecosystem. In addition, functional additions are discussed to make PigConomy sustainable. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE, part of Springer Nature 2023.","","","","","","","","","Blaha T., Sundrum A., Tierärztliche Kompetenz und Zielorientierung erforderlich!-Die aktuelle Tierschutzdebatte ist der Komplexität nicht angemessen, Deutsches Tierärzteblatt, 65, 11, pp. 1518-1521, (2017); Hartmann F., Jahresbericht IQ-Agrar, (2018); Klauke T., Pineiro M., Schulze-Geisthovel S., Plattes S., Selhorst T., Petersen B., Coherence of animal health, welfare and carcass quality in pork production chains, Meat Sci, 95, 3, pp. 704-711, (2013); Tapscott D., Ticoll D., Lowi A., Digital capital-harnessing the power of business webs, (2000); Kollmann T., E-Business-Grundlagen elektronischer Geschäftsprozesse in der digitalen Wirtschaft, (2019); Stahl F., Vossen G., High quality information provisioning and data pricing, ICDE Workshops, pp. 290-293, (2013); Rossignoli C., Ricciardi F., Electronic marketplaces.

It represents an important input for numerous tasks, such as crop growth, development, yield, and irrigation scheduling, to name a few. Advances in technology allow collecting this weather data from heterogeneous sources with high temporal resolution and at low cost. Generating and using these data in their raw form makes no sense, and therefore implementing adequate infrastructure and tools is necessary. For that purpose, this paper presents a smart weather data management system evaluated using data from a meteorological station installed in our study area covering the period from 2013 to 2020 at a half-hourly scale. The proposed system makes use of state-of-the-art statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning models to derive actionable insights from these raw data. The general architecture is made up of four layers: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and application layers. The data sources include real-time sensors, IoT devices, reanalysis data, and raw files. The data are then checked for errors and missing values using a proposed method based on ERA5-Land reanalysis data and deep learning. The resulting coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for this method were 0.96 and 0.04, respectively, for the scaled air temperature estimate. The MongoDB NoSQL database is used for storage thanks to its ability to deal with real-world big data. The system offers various services such as (i) weather time series forecasts, (ii) visualization and analysis of meteorological data, and (iii) the use of machine learning to estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) needed for efficient irrigation. To this, the platform uses the XGBoost model to achieve the precision of the Penman–Monteith method while using a limited number of meteorological variables (air temperature and global solar radiation). Results for this approach give R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07. This system represents the first incremental step toward implementing smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. © 2022 by the authors.","anomaly detection; artificial intelligence; big data analytics; ERA5-Land; evapotranspiration; MongoDB; smart agriculture; time series forecasting","","","","","","Université Mohammed VI Polytechnique, UM6P","This study was supported by and conducted within the Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA) at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Morocco.

Because food is made using crops, it is the basis for people to live. By combining this important agricultural sector with artificial intelligence in the ICT field, we intend to establish the digitalization of agriculture. Recently, smart farm technology continues to develop, and it can provide various results such as future food production predictions. However, there is no platform for big data management and artificial intelligence research specialized in agriculture in Korea yet. To solve these problems, big data uses open data managed by the government, creates a platform that can perform artificial intelligence, and develops a platform that is provided to agricultural researchers. Through the development of this research platform, agricultural big data management and artificial intelligence researchers intend to use it easily to contribute to the improvement of technology in the smart farm field.

The purpose is to form the ability to verify the authenticity of high resolution common products, build the mass production capacity of common products, and improve the overall level of quantitative application of high resolution remote sensing in China. Therefore, how to define common products, what are common products, what are the generating relationships between common products, and between common products and thematic products is a problem that must be solved first. Focusing on these problems, this paper proposes the overall architecture of the national authenticity inspection system for high resolution special projects, that is, the bottom layer is the authenticity inspection station network observation subsystem, building a authenticity inspection station network composed of 42 stations, obtaining the actual authenticity inspection data through sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles and manual measurement, and collecting them in the system database of the middle layer in real time. The middle layer is a subsystem of authenticity inspection and finalization of common products, with integrated data management and sharing, authenticity inspection station network management, authenticity inspection of common products, algorithm model integration testing and finalization of common products and other functions. The top layer is the national remote sensing data and application service platform, which is the portal for authenticity testing. This paper defines the category and grading method of high resolution common products, that is, the standard products are divided into 0—2 levels, which refer to the original image data generated by the special ground system for high resolution, or the image data after system geometric correction and/or radiometric correction; Common products are divided into 3 to 5 levels, which refers to the data obtained by the high resolution special application system using quantitative remote sensing feature parameter inversion method based on standard products as the production input of at least two industry specific products; Thematic products are classified into 6—7 levels, which refer to the data supporting the business application of the industry and department obtained by professional users using quantitative remote sensing characteristic parameter inversion method or multi-source data superposition analysis method based on standard products or generic products. The paper discusses the construction process of the generic product system. Taking agriculture and transportation as examples, it analyzes and deduces the demand for generic products in the production of industry specific products. Furthermore, it deduces the derivative relationship between generic products in the form of product tree, and clarifies the inspection object of the authenticity inspection system and the product catalog that should be focused on, which has important guiding significance for the implementation of the system. After the completion and operation of the national authenticity inspection system, in a sense, it will become a “challenge arena” for common product algorithms. Any algorithm that has been proved to be better through algorithm evaluation will be integrated into the system to replace the original algorithm. These algorithms will also further update the generation process of existing common products iteratively, which will promote each other. © 2023 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

As this agency works to assist data-driven decision-making in animal health management, it continues to use a blend of best practices from Federal Data Strategy initiatives and the International Data Management Association framework. This paper describes three case studies that focus on strategies to improve animal health data collection, integration, reporting and governance for animal health authorities. These strategies have enhanced the way USDA's Veterinary Services execute their mission and core operational activities for prevention, detection and early response to support disease containment and control. © 2023 Estberg L., Luxton J., Spiegel K., Pelzel-McCluskey A., Gomez B.L. & Vanden Eng J.L.; licensee the World Organisation for Animal Health.

This abstract provides an overview of the concept of integrated IoT system solutions for smart agriculture management, highlighting its benefits and applications. The integrated IoT system combines IoT sensors, devices, and cloud-based platforms to enable real- time data collection, analysis, and decision-making in agriculture. By deploying IoT sensors across the farm, farmers can gather data on crucial environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This data empowers farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, leading to optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields. Automation is another key aspect of integrated IoT systems in agriculture. IoT -enabled machinery and equipment, such as tractors, drones, and sensors, can automate tasks like seeding, spraying, and harvesting. This automation reduces manual labor, minimizes errors, and increases operational efficiency. The integration of data analytics and machine learning algorithms in IoT systems enables the extraction of valuable insights from the collected data. Farmers can leverage these insights for proactive decision-making, early disease detection, and yield prediction. In this study, as per the required temperature and relative humidity, tomatoes are grown in spring-summer and pea in winter seasons. To detect the moisture content of the soil at various temperatures and relative humidity levels, soil moisture sensor is also deployed in the field. Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture all exhibit a wide range of variations. In conclusion, the integration of IoT technology in smart agriculture management through an integrated IoT system solution holds great potential for optimizing farming practices, increasing productivity, and promoting sustainable agriculture. Further research and technological advancements are needed to overcome challenges and fully realize the benefits of integrated IoT systems in agriculture.  © 2023 IEEE.","Agri-data management; Internet of Things (IoT); Smart Agriculture","Agricultural technology; Crops; Cultivation; Data Analytics; Decision making; Environmental management; Farms; Forestry; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multivariant analysis; Soil moisture; Agri-data management; Agriculture management; Data analytics; Decisions makings; Environmental data; Internet of thing; Internet of things technologies; Smart agricultures; System solution; Temperature and relative humidity; Information management","","","","","","","Friha O., Ferrag M.A., Shu L., Maglaras L., Wang X., Internet of Things for the Future of Smart Agriculture: A Comprehensive Survey of Emerging Technologies, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 8, 4, pp. 718-752, (2021); Pamuklu T., Nguyen A.C., Syed A., Kennedy W.S., Erol-Kantarci M., IoT-Aerial Base Station Task Offloading With Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning for Smart Agriculture, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, 7, 1, pp. 171-182, (2023); Pagano A., Croce D., Tinnirello I., Vitale G., A Survey on LoRa for Smart Agriculture: Current Trends and Future Perspectives, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 10, 4, pp. 3664-3679, (2023); Misra N.N., Dixit Y., Al-Mallahi A., Bhullar M.S., Upadhyay R., Martynenko A., IoT, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture and Food Industry, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9, 9, pp. 6305-6324, (2022); Saha R., Chakraborty A., Misra S., Das S.K., Chatterjee C., DLSense: Distributed Learning-Based Smart Virtual Sensing for Preci-sion Agriculture, IEEE Sensors Journal, 21, 16, pp. 17556-17563, (2021); Vicente-Guijalba, Martinez-Marin T., Lopez-Sanchez J.M., Dy-namical Approach for Real-Time Monitoring of Agricultural Crops, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 53, 6, pp. 3278-3293, (2015); Farooq M.S., Riaz S., Helou M.A., Khan F.S., Abid A., Alvi A., Internet of Things in Greenhouse Agriculture: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Applications, and Protocols, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 53374-53397, (2022); Ranganathan V., Kumar P., Kaur U., Li S.H.Q., Chakraborty T., Chandra R., Re-Inventing the Food Supply Chain with IoT: A Data-Driven Solution to Reduce Food Loss, IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 5, 1, pp. 41-47; Sharma S.D., Green biocomposites: A prospective utilization in automobile industry, Green Energy and Technology, pp. 167-191, (2017); Zhang Q., Chen D., Mahajan Y., Chen I.-R., Ha D.S., Cho J.-H., Attack-Resistant, Energy-Adaptive Monitoring for Smart Farms: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach, IEEE Internet of Things Journal; Chaudhary P., Et al., Application of Synthetic Consortia for Im-provement of Soil Fertility, Pollution Remediation, and Agricultural Productivity: A Review, Agronomy, 13, 3, (2023); Singh S.P., Shivam, Kumar I., Rice plant infection recognition using deep neural network systems, International Semantic Intelligence Conference (ISIC 2021), pp. 25-27","","Chaudhary N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Technological Advancements in Computational Sciences, ICTACS 2023","1 November 2023 through 3 November 2023","Tashkent","196891","","979-835034233-8","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Controversy forms an essential part of the scientific process, but on the topic of soil carbon storage, it may confuse the agricultural community and the general public and may delay actions to fight climate change. In an attempt to shed light on this topic, the originality of this article lies in its intention to provide a balanced description of contradictory scientific opinions on soil carbon storage and to examine how the scientific community can support decision-making despite the controversy. In the first part, we review and attempt to reconcile conflicting views on the mechanisms controlling organic carbon dynamics in soil. We discuss the divergent opinions about chemical recalcitrance, the microbial or plant origin of persistent soil organic matter, the contribution of particulate organic matter to additional organic carbon storage in soil, and the spatial and energetic inaccessibility of soil organic matter to decomposers. In the second part, we examine the advantages and limitations of big data management and modeling, which are essential tools to link the latest scientific theories with the actions taken by stakeholders. Finally, we show how the analysis and discussion of controversies can guide scientists in supporting stakeholders for the design of (i) appropriate trade-offs for biomass use in agriculture and forestry and (ii) climate-smart management practices, keeping in mind their still unresolved effects on soil carbon storage. © 2023, The Author(s).","Big data; Biomass use; Carbon storage; Chemical recalcitrance; Inaccessibility; Management practices; Models; POM","biomass; carbon storage; chemical analysis; literature review; management practice; numerical model; particulate organic matter; policy making; soil carbon","","","","","AgroEcoSytem; EcoDiv departments; Institut National de Recherche pour l'Agriculture, l'Alimentation et l'Environnement, INRAE","This publication emerged from a workshop organized in December 2019 by the CarboSMS (Carbon Stabilization Mechanisms in Soil) research network at the École Normale Supérieure de Paris, France.

Agricultural production and management modes guided by data and services have become a cutting-edge carrier of agricultural information monitoring, which promotes the transformation of the intelligent computing of remote sensing big data and agricultural intensive management from theory to practical applications. In this paper, the main research objective is to construct a new high-frequency agricultural production monitoring and intensive sharing service and management mode, based on the three dimensions of space, time, and attributes, that includes crop recognition, growth monitoring, yield estimation, crop disease or pest monitoring, variable-rate prescription, agricultural machinery operation, and other automatic agricultural intelligent computing applications. The platforms supported by this mode include a data management and agricultural information production subsystem, an agricultural monitoring and macro-management subsystem (province and county scales), and two mobile terminal applications (APPs). Taking Shandong as the study area of the application case, the technical framework of the system and its mobile terminals were systematically elaborated at the province and county levels, which represented macro-management and precise control of agricultural production, respectively. The automatic intelligent computing mode of satellite–air–ground spatiotemporal collaboration that we proposed fully couples data obtained from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and IoT technologies, which can provide the accurate and timely monitoring of agricultural conditions and real-time guidance for agricultural machinery scheduling throughout the entire process of agricultural cultivation, planting, management, and harvest; the area accuracy of all obtained agricultural information products is above 90%. This paper demonstrates the necessity of customizable product and service research in agricultural intelligent computing, and the proposed practical mode can provide support for governments to participate in agricultural macro-management and decision making, which is of great significance for smart farming development and food security. © 2023 by the authors.","agriculture; decision making; intelligent computing; IoT; mobile terminal application; remote sensing; satellite–air–ground; smart farming; software system; UAV","","","","","","Shandong Province, (2021YFB3901300); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China and Shandong Province, China (2021YFB3901300).","Wang Z., Yang X., Zhou C., Geographic knowledge graph for remote sensing big data, J.

The sensor provides insights into crop nutrient absorption efficiency and alterations in specific ion concentrations in response to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) fluctuations. Solid-contact ion-selective electrodes were fabricated into an ion sensor array and interfaced with wireless embedded systems to construct an IoT nutrient sensor system (IoNSS). The IoNSS framework included two different microcontrollers for nutrient solution sampling, sensing module controlling, automated procedure setting, and data recording: a private cloud server for data management and MQTT webpage-based interactive interfaces. The IoNSS enables real-time assessment of changes in electrical conductivity values and specific element concentrations (mathrm{N}{{mathrm{O}}_{3}}{rm{ - }},mathrm{N}{{mathrm{H}}_{4}}{rm{ + }}, Ca2+, and K+,) in nutrient solutions within a commercial hydroponic greenhouse. It also facilitates the determination of the mathrm{N}{{mathrm{O}}_{3}}{rm{ - }}/mathrm{N}{{mathrm{H}}_{4}}{rm{ + }} ratio, aiding in tracking nitrogen fertilization absorbed by plants. Decreases in K+ concentration measured by the IoNSS correlate with deviations from normal VPD levels, indicating leaf transpiration efficiency. Measurement of other ions reflects physiological disorders resulting from abnormal VPD. In summary, the IoNSS provides specific-element information crucial for adjusting environmental parameters and optimizing greenhouse environmental control strategies, thus advancing precision agriculture in hydroponic cultivation. © 2017 IEEE.","hydroponics; nutrient management; precision agriculture; Sensor materials; solid-contact ion-selective electrode (SCISE)","Crops; Cultivation; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Environmental management; Greenhouses; Internet of things; Ions; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Precision agriculture; Transpiration; Ion-selective electrode; Ion-sensors; Nutrient absorption; Nutrient management; Precision Agriculture; Sensor systems; Sensors array; Solid contacts; Solid-contact ion-selective electrode; Vapor pressure deficit; Hydroponics","","","","","","","Khan S., Purohit A., Vadsaria N., Hydroponics: Current and future state of the art in farming, J.

Different user groups are involved in this process: farmers, agricultural service providers, as well as agronomists. They all need to collect or work with this kind of data. In order to achieve sustainable data-management and-analysis, a higher-level information source for data is required. The most sophisticated approach, ‘data about data’-or metadata-is regarded to be the solution to the problem described above. Due to the diversity of users in the agricultural community, a metadata standard is required that is public domain, popular, platform-independent and flexible so that it can be adapted to PA. The standard complying with these requirements is the ISO 19115-metadata standard, with its possibility of profile creation and hierarchical structure composition. Using this standard reduces the expense of data survey and data administration to a minimum. In this paper, a profile for PA, based on the ISO 19115 standard is proposed. Moreover, a tool for creation and administration of metadata files, fulfilling the profile for PA, will be drafted. © Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands, 2003.","geoinformation; GIS; ISO 19115; metadata; metadata profiles","","","","","","","","Bill R., Korduan P., Meta Information and Management System for Precision Agriculture, In: Proceedings Agroenviron 2000, pp. 83-91, (2000); Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.

However, there is a lack of a standard model to support streamlined management and integration of the data generated from advanced measurement systems used in tree crop research. Furthermore, the rapid expansion in the diversity and volumes of data is increasingly highlighting the requirement for a comprehensive data model and an ecosystem for efficient orchard management and decision-making. This research focuses on the design and implementation of a novel proof-of-concept data ecosystem that enables improved data storage, management, integration, processing, analysis, and usage. Contemporary technologies proliferating in other sectors but that have had limited adoption in agricultural research have been incorporated into the model. The core of the proposed solution is a service-oriented API-driven system coupled with a standard-based digital orchard model. Applying this solution in Agriculture Victoria’s Tatura tree crop research farm (the Tatura SmartFarm) has significantly reduced overheads in research data management, enhanced analysis, and improved data resolution. This is demonstrated by the preliminary results presented for in-orchard and postharvest data collection applications. The data ecosystem developed as part of this research also establishes a foundation for early fruit traceability across industry and research. © 2023 by the authors.","API; data; data integration; FAIR; orchard; research data management; traceability","","","","","","Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, DEECA","This research was funded by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) and its predecessors.","Wilkinson M.D., Dumontier M., Aalbersberg I.J., Appleton G., Axton M., Baak A., Blomberg N., Boiten J.W., da Silva Santos L.B., Bourne P.E., Et al., The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship, Sci.

However, the meat industry has lagged behind in adopting data-driven approaches, underscoring the crucial need for data standardisation to facilitate seamless data transmission to maximise productivity, save costs, and increase market access. To address this gap, we propose a novel data schema, Livestock Event Information (LEI) schema, designed to accurately and uniformly record livestock events. LEI complies with the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) and Integrity System Company (ISC) schemas to deliver this data standardisation and enable data sharing between producers and consumers. To validate the superiority of LEI, we conducted a structural metrics analysis and a comprehensive case study. The analysis demonstrated that LEI outperforms the ICAR and ISC schemas in terms of design, while the case study confirmed its superior ability to capture livestock event information. Our findings lay the foundation for the implementation of the LEI schema, unlocking the potential for data-driven advances in livestock management. Moreover, LEI's versatility opens avenues for future expansion into other agricultural domains, encompassing poultry, fisheries, and crops. The adoption of LEI promises substantial benefits, including improved data accuracy, reduced costs, and increased productivity, heralding a new era of sustainability in the meat industry. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cattle information; Data sharing; Data standardisation; Event modelling; Livestock events","Agriculture; Information dissemination; Cattle information; Data driven; Data Sharing; Data standardization; Event model; Information schema; Integrity systems; Livestock event; Meat industry; Recording systems; cattle; data management; data transmission; livestock farming; meat; productivity; sustainability; Standardization","","","","","","","Allan J., Papka R., Lavrenko V., On-line new event detection and tracking, Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 37-45, (1998); Alshuqayran N., Ali N., Evans R., A systematic mapping study in microservice architecture, 2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA, pp. 44-51, (2016); Antonino P.O., Capilla R., Pelliccione P., Schnicke F., Espen D., Kuhn T., Schmid K., A quality 4.0 model for architecting industry 4.0 systems, Adv.

In this work, we have used a variant of CRISP-DM and broken-down processes into sub-processes, meanwhile also integrating critical success factors in the framework. We have validated our framework to understand BDA adoption via a case study of a big data analytics firm, referred to as ABC in this study. ABC helps large farmers to make farming decisions based on BDA. We conducted in-depth interviews with the Data science team of ABC to validate our framework. In terms of critical success factors, costing, project planning, adoption strategy, identification of business problems, project team formation, data management, training, change management and final preparation were identified as important by ABC for BDA projects. In addition, ABC also considers maintenance, evaluation of business objectives and overall project management critical that were not part of our model. We have incorporated these in our framework.

This study delves deeply into the uses, advantages, disadvantages, and potential future developments of AIoT in farming. There is an urgent need to address the rising global food demand, resource scarcity, and the need for sustainable agricultural techniques, all of which are briefly discussed in the longer abstract as the impetus for adopting AIoT in agriculture. It shows how AIoT’s ability to collect, analyze, and make intelligent decisions in real time may improve agricultural efficiency, crop productivity, and resource management. Precision farming, smart irrigation, crop monitoring, animal management, insect detection, and autonomous machinery are just a few of the many uses explored for AIoT in this field. Each use case is examined in depth to show how AIoT technologies are revolutionizing conventional farming methods and easing the burdens on today’s farmers. This chapter also considers the pros and cons of using AIoT in agriculture, including the potential for increased production, decreased resource waste, better data-driven decision-making, and the requirement for strong cybersecurity safeguards and data protection. High upfront expenses, interoperability problems, data management and ownership concerns, and the requirement for farmer education and training are only some of the hurdles that the study considers. The potential of AIoT in farming is discussed, as is the use of cutting-edge technology such as blockchain, edge computing, and autonomous drones. This chapter also explores the potential policy and regulatory implications of AIoT in agriculture to facilitate its responsible and long-term deployment. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Lakshmi D., Ravi Shekhar Tiwari, Rajesh Kumar Dhanaraj and Seifedine Kadry; individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Guillen M.A., Et al., Performance evaluation of edge-computing platforms for the prediction of low temperatures in agriculture using deep learning, J.

The Sri Lankan construction industry has many complications associated with contract management. Blockchain, as a decentralised transaction and data management technology, can potentially address the issues related to contract management amidst the impediments to effective implementation. However, blockchain technology adaptation in the Sri Lankan construction industry lacks evidence, even though other sectors, for example, banking and agriculture, are with the initial implementation. Hence, this research aimed to identify the potential impacts of implementing blockchain technology in construction contract management in Sri Lanka. A literature review was conducted to identify the concept of blockchain technology, its applications and its benefits. A qualitative survey strategy was adopted, and data were collected via semi-structured interviews in two phases; Phase I with ICT and finance industry experts and Phase II with construction contract experts. Samples were selected purposively through snowball sampling. The data analysis revealed that the awareness and use of blockchain technology in Sri Lanka are relatively low. However, Sri Lanka has the potential to adopt Blockchain in different fields, depending on their capabilities. Furthermore, the study found associated positive impacts of Blockchain, e.g., avoiding complex procedures, providing transparency, no ambiguities, no human errors and reducing political influence to mitigate contract management issues. Besides, Blockchain may negatively impact due to, e.g., high initial and maintenance costs, lack of knowledge and expertise, unavailability of rules and regulations, and reluctance to change those need mitigations. © 2023, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

They therefore have an important role to play in eradicating food insecurity and poverty among the world’s growing population. Although there are different digital services for smallholder farmers, the existing services lack sustainability in the agriculture context and hardly meet their needs. Data management and sharing among different agriculture stakeholders has the potential to make agriculture sustainable, but there is a need to enable access to digital services in an entire farming cycle under one roof. This paper aims to propose the design of a comprehensive data management digital framework to solve common challenges of smallholder farmers in Tanzania and other countries’ agricultural systems. We follow the design science research (DSR) method to develop an artifact that interacts with the problem context. To illustrate the framework’s applicability, we use different case studies in Tanzania. © 2023 The Author(s).

Precision agriculture is mainly deployed for machine efficiencies and soil-based zonal management, and the traditional paradigm of small plot research fails to unite agronomic research and effective management under farmers’ unique field constraints. This work assesses the use of on-farm experiments applied with precision agriculture technologies and open-source data to gain local knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability in agroeconomic performance on the subfield scale to accelerate learning and overcome the bias inherent in traditional research approaches. The on-farm precision experimentation methodology is an approach to improve farmers’ abilities to make site-specific agronomic input decisions by simulating a distribution of economic outcomes for the producer using field-specific crop response models that account for spatiotemporal uncertainty in crop responses. The methodology is the basis of a decision support system that includes a six-step cyclical process that engages precision agriculture technology to apply experiments, gather field-specific data, incorporate modern data management and analytical approaches, and generate management recommendations as probabilities of outcomes. The quantification of variability in crop response to inputs and drawing on historic knowledge about the field and economic constraints up to the time a decision is required allows for probabilistic inference that a future management scenario will outcompete another in terms of production, economics, and sustainability. The proposed methodology represents advancement over other approaches by comparing management strategies and providing the probability that each will increase producer profits over their previous input management on the field scale. © 2023 by the authors.","agroecology; crop modeling; crop production; decision support system; ecological management; on-farm experimentation; optimization","","","","","","MREDI, (51040-MUSR12015-02); Montana Fertilizer Advisory Council; USDA-NIFA-AFRI, (2016-68004-24769); Western SARE, WSARE, (GW19-190); Western SARE, WSARE; Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, (NR213A7500013G021); Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Bruce Maxwell reports that financial support was provided by the Montana Fertilizer Advisory Council.

New technologies and solutions were developed and get invented which ease farmers’ daily life, help them and their partners to gain knowledge about farming processes and environmental interrelations. This knowledge leads to better decisions and contributes to increased farm productivity, resource efficiency, and environmental health. Along with numerous advantages, some negative aspects and dependencies risk seamless workflow of agricultural production. Therefore, this study presents the state of the art of digitization in agriculture and points out vulnerabilities in digitized farming processes. The most important are the lack of interoperability and the dependency on internet connection. Hence, requirements are posed to meet these vulnerabilities in future IT (information technology) systems resulting in successive levels of resilience that cover the individual needs of farms adjusted to their mobile and landline internet supply. These findings are incorporated in a conceptual framework for a highly digitized fictive farm. Resilience is ensured by decentralized storage and computing capacities and internet independent communication networks including cooperation with machinery rings and contractors. © 2022","Agriculture; Internet independence; Internet of things; Interoperability; Precision farming; Small and middle scaled farms","","","","","","EIP-AGRI; European Commission, EC","The present study was carried out as part of the MR digital project, a project under the EIP-AGRI funding measure of the European Union.

Because most IoT devices have limited resources, the vital requirement to efficiently manage data traffic while ensuring data security in agricultural IoT solutions creates several challenges. Therefore, it is important to study the data amount that IoT protocols generate for resource-constrained devices, as it has a direct impact on the device performance and overall usability of the IoT solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that focuses on optimizing data transmission in agricultural IoT solutions with the use of compression algorithms and secure technologies. Through experimentation and analysis, we evaluate different approaches to minimize data traffic while protecting sensitive agricultural data. Our results highlight the effectiveness of compression algorithms, especially Huffman coding, in reducing data size and optimizing resource usage. In addition, the integration of encryption techniques, such as AES, provides the security of the transmitted data without incurring significant overhead. By assessing different communication scenarios, we identify the most efficient approach, a combination of Huffman encoding and AES encryption, to strike a balance between data security and transmission efficiency. © 2024 by the authors.","data compression; internet of things; precision agriculture; resource optimization; secure communication","Cryptography; Data compression; Farms; Information management; Precision agriculture; Sensitive data; Compression algorithms; Data traffic; Device performance; Direct impact; Farming practices; Internet of things technologies; Precision Agriculture; Protocol analyze; Resourceconstrained devices; Resources optimization; Internet of things","","","","","European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ, (IP-2019-04-1986); Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ","This work has been supported in part by the project IoT-field: An Ecosystem of Networked Devices and Services for IoT Solutions Applied in Agriculture funded by European Union from the European Regional Development Fund and by Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2019-04-1986 IoT4us: Smart human-centric services in interoperable and decentralized IoT environments.","Shafi U., Mumtaz R., Garcia-Nieto J., Hassan S.A., Zaidi S.A.R., Iqbal N., Precision Agriculture Techniques and Practices: From Considerations to Applications, Sensors, 19, (2019); Gebbers R., Adamchuk V.I., Precision Agriculture and Food Security, Science, 327, pp. 828-831, (2010); Sishodia R.P., Ray R.L., Singh S.K., Applications of Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture: A Review, Remote Sens, 12, (2020); Zhai Z., Martinez J.F., Beltran V., Martinez N.L., Decision support systems for agriculture 4.0: Survey and challenges, Comput.

Rural economic data mainly include rural labor force, added value of agriculture, forestry, fishery and animal husbandry, agricultural product output and per capita net income. Using big data to manage economic data can not only integrate and analyze a large number of data, build an economic management analysis database, but also predict and warn related risks in time and provide reasonable and effective economic management suggestions, thus ensuring the smooth operation of the economy. However, there are some shortcomings in data reliability, data quality and data management efficiency in rural regional economic data management, which have a great impact on the long-term stable development of the economy. This paper makes a systematic analysis of rural regional economic data, uses the blockchain consensus mechanism to quickly manage and analyze different types of economy in rural areas, and improves the speed of economic data analysis through smart contracts. This paper makes a comparative analysis of rural regional economic data management before and after adopting blockchain technology. In view of this phenomenon, according to the development demand of data management, this paper uses blockchain technology to effectively analyze and study the big data management of rural regional economy, and makes a comparative analysis through the tests of data operation efficiency, data quality, data management security and sharing degree. The experimental data show that the efficiency of data operation is as high as 1100 times per minute after the combination of blockchain technology, and the minimum manual modification ratio of node data is 0.24. This shows that the data quality of technical means is guaranteed. The data leakage rate per hour is at least 66%, and the data sharing volume is maintained at about 8000 views/hour and 7000 references/hour.

Amazing gains in output, efficiency, and quality are now possible in agriculture thanks to cloud computing. This abstract provides a thorough examination of the benefits, uses, and difficulties of implementing cloud computing in smart farming. In this chapter’s first section, we take a look at the basics of conventional farming, including its definition, characteristics, and outcomes. Traditional farming, in contrast to modern industrial agriculture, makes use of tried-and-true techniques that have been passed down from generation to generation. Instead of relying heavily on mechanical technology and synthetic chemicals, natural processes, local knowledge, and physical labor are utilized. Local communities, cultures, and ecosystems all play a significant role in traditional farming. Typical features include the use of natural manures, crop rotation, and polycultures. Despite criticism that it is less effective than modern techniques, the sustainable and holistic approach it takes is based on thousands of years of wisdom. Their sustainable, holistic approach is based on centuries of experience and offers invaluable insights and practices, especially in light of the current environmental and climate problems, despite prevalent assumptions that traditional ways are less productive. The use of cloud computing in “smart farming” can take many forms. This chapter explains how to use cloud computing to its full potential throughout the various steps of smart farming, such as data management, data retrieval, data storage and dissemination, real-time data analysis, remote monitoring and control, improved decision support systems, and continuous improvement. Even while smart farming can benefit greatly from cloud computing, there are still some obstacles to overcome. In this chapter, we dive deep into the problems that lie at the heart of data privacy, data quality, digital literacy, and inadequate infrastructure. In addition, it explores issues related to vendor lock-in and privacy in an effort to create a safe space for intelligent farming. Potential answers and novel approaches are presented for the scalability and computational overload challenges plaguing cloud computing systems. Finally, the chapter explores the prospects of cloud computing integrated with smart farming. It discusses potential advancements in soil monitoring, climate prediction, and supply chain management, which have the potential to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of agricultural processes. Moreover, the abstract encourages collaboration between farmers, researchers, and cloud architects to establish guidelines and frameworks that promote responsible and ethical usage of cloud computing technologies in the agricultural sector. This abstract serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the significance of cloud computing in smart farming. By illuminating its applications, challenges, and potential future directions, it provides researchers, farmers, and decision-makers with valuable insights to harness the full potential of cloud computing and drive the agricultural industry into a more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."," Cloud computing;  Precision agriculture;  Quality control;  Supply chain management;  Traditional farming; Smart farming","Agricultural technology; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data privacy; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Efficiency; Farms; Fertilizers; Information management; Internet of things; Manures; Quality control; Real time systems; Search engines; Supply chain management; Cloud-computing; Computing machines; Holistic approach; Machine-learning; Output quality; Precision Agriculture; Precision-farming; Smart agricultures; Smart farming; Traditional farming; Precision agriculture","","","","","","","Wells J.C.K., Stock J.T., Life history transitions at the origins of farming: “A model for understanding how niche construction impacts human growth, demography and health”, Front.

The water environment monitoring platform is specifically designed to support efficient device management and long-term data storage. The platform targets two types of users: system administrators and end users. End users, consisting of device owners and users with shared permissions to view devices’ data, can make identity requests to store data, manage created devices, monitor and track data, and share permission to view any sensors’ data on the device with other users. Meanwhile, system administrators verify device creation requests and renew a device’s access token. Our platform leverages several technologies, including Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric to store device data, Firebase to store device information and manage users, Nodejs to create server-side APIs that communicate with the Blockchain network, and ReactJS and Reactnative to develop client-side interfaces. The effectiveness of the platform has been evaluated through a series of experiments, and the results show reasonable throughput. These technologies have enabled effective and efficient environmental monitoring and data management in modern agriculture and aquaculture. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Caliper; Hyperledger Fabric; IoT Sensor Data Management","Application programming interfaces (API); Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Information management; Internet of things; Automated device; Block-chain; Caliper; Device data; End-users; Environmental Monitoring; Hyperledg fabric; IoT sensor data management; Sensor data management; System administrators; Blockchain","","","","","","","Ojha T., Misra S., Raghuwanshi N.S., Wireless sensor networks for agriculture: The state-of-the-art in practice and future challenges, Comput.

The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) for data collection is an important part of smart agriculture. Many related studies have shown that remote data management and cloud computing make it possible and practical to monitor the functionality of IoT devices. In automated agriculture, machine learning intelligence is more necessary to use to automatically determine whether the correlation between learning factors influences plant growth patterns. In this research experiment, the relevant data are automatically collected through a detection device, and data modeling and computation are performed in an edge computing environment. At the same time, the data model is transmitted via the communication protocol, and another node is available for verification of the modeling and calculation results. The experimental results show that the single-point data-trained model is able to accurately predict the growth trend of the plants. In the case of verification of the second measurement point at a different space, the data model must be trained with more than two layers in order to improve the training results and reduce errors. © 2023 by the authors.","data modeling; edge computing; factor selection analysis; intelligent agriculture; machine learning","","","","","","National Science and Technology Council of the Republic of China, (MOST 111-2221-E-031-006)","This paper was partially supported by the National Science and Technology Council of the Republic of China under contract MOST 111-2221-E-031-006.","Akhter R., Sofi S.A., Precision agriculture using IoT data analytics and machine learning, J.

To meet the projected 60% increase in food demand by 2050, efficient production and sustainable practices are crucial. Smart technologies like sensors and drones address climate change's impact on agriculture by monitoring crops and adapting to changing conditions. However, smart agriculture generates vast amounts of data that traditional methods struggle to handle. As probabilistic data structures, Bloom filters offer efficient solutions for data management by enabling quick identification and retrieval without extensive computational resources. They are particularly useful in crop disease detection, aiding prompt management and prevention. Scalable Bloom Filters (SBF) address limitations like false positives and dataset size by dynamically expanding the filter as the dataset grows. SBF improves efficiency, reliability, data security, and transmission by limiting access to authorized nodes, reducing congestion and costs. Using SBF in smart agriculture makes the data storage, collection, and transmission process less time-consuming, space efficient, and with higher accuracy. © 2023 IEEE.","authentication; crops; data collection; data transmission; probabilistic data structure; redundancy; scalable bloom filter; sensors; smart agriculture; wireless sensor network","Climate change; Data acquisition; Data communication systems; Data structures; Digital storage; Farms; Information management; Population statistics; Redundancy; Wireless sensor networks; Bloom filters; Data collection; Data storage; Data-transmission; Population growth; Probabilistic data; Probabilistic data structure; Scalable bloom filter; Smart agricultures; Sustainable Farming; Crops","","","","","","","Bacco M., Barsocchi P., Ferro E., Gotta A., Ruggeri M., The digitisation of agriculture: A survey of research activities on smart farming, Array, 3, (2019); Zhao J., Liu D., Huang R., A Review of Climate-Smart Agriculture: Recent Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions, Sustainability, 15, 4, (2023); Yoon C., Huh M., Kang S.G., Park J., Lee C., Implement smart farm with IoT technology, 2018 20th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT), pp. 749-752, (2018); Baldovino R.G., Valenzuela I.C., Dadios E.P., Implementation of a Low-Power Wireless Sensor Network for Smart Farm Applications, 2018 IEEE 10th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (HNICEM), pp. 1-5, (2018); Singh A., Garg S., Kaur R., Batra S., Kumar N., Zomaya A.Y., Probabilistic Data Structures for Big Data Analytics: A Comprehensive Review, Knowledge-Based Systems, 188, (2020); Bloom B.H., Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors, Communications of the ACM, 13, 7, pp. 422-426, (1970); Geravand S., Ahmadi M., Bloom filter applications in network security: A state-of-the-art survey, Computer Networks, 57, 18, pp. 4047-4064, (2013); Geravand S., Ahmadi M., Bloom filter applications in network security: A state-of-the-art survey, Computer Networks, 57, 18, pp. 4047-4064, (2013); Mbarek B., Sahli N., Jabeur N., BFAN: A bloom filter-based authentication in wireless sensor networks, 2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC).

At the heart of our investigation is the exploration of blockchain’s decentralized architecture, its role in enhancing transparency, and the security of data management and transactions. We delve into blockchain’s capacity to address critical challenges in sustainable development, such as supply chain traceability, resource management efficiency, and the integrity of data exchanges. Emphasizing blockchain’s potential in aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we propose an innovative blockchain model that navigates integration challenges, ensuring compatibility, security, and privacy. This model features a layered architectural approach, combining public and private blockchain elements, and integrates advanced cryptographic methods, including Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Multi-party Computation, to bolster its security and privacy capabilities. We critically assess the challenges in blockchain adoption, such as scalability, interoperability with legacy systems, and regulatory compliance, proposing strategic solutions and future research directions. Our study synthesizes insights from various case studies and theoretical analyses to demonstrate blockchain’s role in fostering ethical sourcing, promoting a circular economy, and enhancing social inclusion. By offering a comprehensive view of blockchain’s capabilities and limitations, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on leveraging technology for sustainable development, providing a foundation for future innovations and policymaking in this dynamic field. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Blockchain; Cryptography; Data Integrity; Decentralization; Multi-party Computation; Security; Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Development; Transparency; Zero-Knowledge Proofs","Blockchain; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; Interoperability; Knowledge management; Legacy systems; Regulatory compliance; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Transparency; Block-chain; Critical challenges; Data integrity; Decentralisation; Decentralized architecture; In-depth analysis; Multiparty computation; Security; Security and privacy; Zero-knowledge proofs; Cryptography","","","","","","","Munir M.A., Et al., blockchain adoption for sustainable supply chain management: Economic, environmental, and social perspectives, Front.

Our analysis is situated within the settler colonial context of Aotearoa New Zealand. We consider how obligations detailed within treaties guaranteeing equal partnership and Māori self-determination provide the foundation for: (1) acknowledging how the promises of agricultural big data depend on the people, priorities, practices and power relations that guide and enact them; and (2) creating the space to question and challenge current trajectories to ensure agricultural big data are collected and used in ways that promote data sovereignty and an equitable distribution of benefits.

The aim of this study was to understand scientifically the shortcomings of ecological compensation policies for conservation tillage in the black soil areas of Northeast China and to explore the optimization paths for the compensation policies for conservation tillage technology with a problem-oriented approach, which could provide a scientific basis for making up for the shortcomings of the system and achieving precise policy implementation. The subsidy standard of corn straw returning technology in northeast black soil region was summarized, the practical constraints of subsidy policy were qualitatively analyzed, and the main obstacle factors of current conservation tillage support policy were clarified by comprehensively utilizing literature analysis, normative analysis, and inductive deduction methods combined with field research. Three core issues were included the unclear direction of compensation policy, the unscientific basis for standard compensation pricing, and the incomplete management mechanism and institutional system. In response to the practical difficulties that ecological compensation for conservation tillage faces in black soil areas, three paths for optimizing the policy mechanism were proposed: first, the empowerment and systematization were strengthened to activate the subjectivity path of conservation tillage, and the supporting policies were established from two levels: improving empowerment positioning and cultivating new business entities. Second, a collaborative, quantitative, and standardized compensation evaluation method was constructed for environmental-economic attributes, external effects and subjective effects generated by technology were used as the theoretical basis for pricing compensation standards, and then an evaluation method system was established with integrated multiple methods, including alternative market technology, hypothetical market technology, and econometric statistical analysis. Third, a high-quality digital management and differentiated ecological compensation system was prepared for building an open and shared big data management platform, creating an ecological market picture of multi-agent collaboration and mutual benefit, and establishing multi-agent conservation tillage collaboration and a differentiated ecological compensation mechanism. In order to adapt to the new requirements for technical innovation and organizational changes in conservation tillage, a scientific evaluation system was established for the application of green technologies in conservation tillage agriculture, and optimizing the vertical management and vertical compensation mechanism, guiding enterprises and social capital to participate in market regulation, and building an ecological management system barrier for the protection and improvement of cultivated land quality in black soil areas, which provided references for optimizing the ecological compensation policy. © 2023 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can provide data about agricultural fields and then operate based on human input. The IoT is cloud-based technology that allows for scalable management, data management, data security, data analysis, and more. The present IoT solutions are not suitable for the Indian agriculture sector due to it being very complex and not being cost-effective, which means it is not applicable to the reality on the ground. The existing IoT solutions employ paid network GSM/NB-IoT/4G/5G for sensor networks. In this chapter, a holistic affordable IoT framework focused on the agriculture Indian scenario is proposed. The IoT end nodes are battery-operated, and power consumption should be low and adopt low-power wide-area network technology. Cloud services included the weather department, agriculture scientists of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, e-mandi, the Indian market, the nearest point for selling, and so on. It also includes the monitoring of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, irrigation and insect and pest detection, actuator intervention, message notification for disastrous weather warnings, and expert advice for farmers. Crop monitoring via by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

The data collected from forecasts through different sources have been helpful in avoiding some calamities. The forecast applications are built with conventional database systems; processing and reaching real-time data without being tampered with for farmers is a bottleneck. Most of the time, weather providers' data doesn't match what happens in the farming fields. These differences can lead to heavy damage, especially during unexpected weather strikes. In the current age, smart agriculture makes use of modern equipment such as sensors and satellites that give forecasts more precisely and carefully compiled. The present paper shows an Edge hub near the IoAT device that controls all sensor devices to establish bidirectional communication and embeds Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) for weather data integrity in immediate time. We present a novel architecture with algorithms for this weather data management system and implement the system to see the performance with real-time sensor data. © 2023 IEEE.","Agriculture Cyber-Physical System (A-CPS); Blockchain; Distributed Ledger (DL); Edge-Computing; Internet-of-Agro- Things (IoAT); Smart Agriculture","Agriculture; Cyber Physical System; Distributed ledger; Embedded systems; Information management; Meteorology; Real time systems; Agriculture cybe-physical system; Block-chain; Conventional database; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Distributed ledg; Edge computing; Internet-of-agro- thing; Smart agricultures; Weather data; Blockchain","","","","","","","Lemoine D., Shrader J., Bakkensen L., Weather forecast accuracy is crucial in a heat wave-1 degree can mean the difference between life and death, Phys.Org, 2023; Vangipuram S.L.T., Mohanty S.P., Kougianos E., Ray C., agroString: Visibility and Provenance through a Private Blockchain Platform for Agricultural Dispense towards Consumers, Sensors, 22, 21, (2022); Tripathy P.K., Tripathy A.K., Agarwal A., Mohanty S.P., My-Green: An IoT-Enabled Smart Greenhouse for Sustainable Agriculture, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 10, 4, pp. 57-62, (2021); Purwandari K., Perbangsa A.S., Sigalingging J.W.C., Krisna A.A., Anggrayani S., Pardamean B., Database Management System Design for Automatic Weather Information with Twitter Data Collection, Proc. of International Conference on Information Management and Technology (ICIMTech), 1, 2021, pp. 326-330; Andrian Y., Maryam E., DaeYong K., Maeng S.H., Ju H., Space Weather Data Management System and Monitoring in Decentralized Storage Environment, Proc. of 20th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS), pp. 1-4, (2019); Kodali R.K., Sahu A., An IoT based weather information prototype using WeMos, Proc. of 2nd International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics (IC3I), pp. 612-616, (2016); Tsao Y.-C., Tsai Y.T., Kuo Y.-W., Hwang C., An Implementation of IoT-Based Weather Monitoring System, Proc. of IEEE International Conferences on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications (IUCC) and Data Science and Computational Intelligence (DSCI) and Smart Computing, Networking and Services (SmartCNS), pp. 648-652, (2019); Osorio E.E.C., Kang S., Kim B.-S., Lim J., Kim K.H., Kim K.-I., Development of data collecting system for forecasting with meteorological sensors, Proc. of International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN), pp. 453-456, (2017); 6 tools our meteorologists use to forecast the weather, (2017); what is IoT hub, (2020); Technolog S., What is Blockchain as a service ?, (2019); Vangipuram S.L.T., Mohanty S.P., Kougianos E., Ray C., G-DaM: A Distributed Data Storage with Blockchain Framework for Management of Groundwater Quality Data, Sensors, 22, 22, (2022); Sukrutha V., Mohanty S.P., Kougianos E., Ray C., G-DaM: A Blockchain based Distributed Robust Framework for Ground Water Data Management, Proc. of IEEE International Symposium on Smart Electronic Systems (iSES), 2021, pp. 261-266; How long does it take to upload GB data to the Cloud?, (2014)","S.L.T.

Environmental factors are known to affect plant growth include light, temperature, water, humidity and nutrition. Thus, it's very important to understand how those factors affect plant growth and development. A wireless IoT monitoring platform is proposed in this paper to collect four environmental data for the study of factors affecting soil water evaporation. It is achieved by the development of wireless sensor network (WSN) modules to cope with different types of sensor for temperature, humidity, sun-light and water tension. First, four types of environmental data are collected through the interface designed in the proposed WSN module. The collected data is then uploaded to the cloud database via a 2G/3G/4G LTE router. Finally, the code MySQL is employed for the data management and analysis while code MATLAB is used for data visualization to facilitate analysis and comparison. A comparison of the collected information and the data obtained from the Hsinchu Weather Station, Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Taiwan, R.O.C. is obtained to demonstrate the success of the proposed design.  © 2023 IEEE.","agriculture; IoT; monitoring","Agricultural technology; Codes (symbols); Data Analytics; Data visualization; Information management; MATLAB; Soil moisture; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural technologies; Data analytics; Environmental data; Environmental factors; Growth and development; Monitoring platform; Plant development; Plant growth; Soil water evaporation; Wireless internet; Internet of things","","","","","","","Clercq M.D., Vats A., Biel A., Agriculture 4. 0: The future of farming technology, Oliver Wyman, (2018); VanDerZanden A.M., Environmental factors affecting plant growth, (2008); Kirci P., Ozturk E., Celik Y., A Novel Approach for Monitoring of Smart Greenhouse and Flowerpot Parameters and Detection of Plant Growth with Sensors, Agriculture, 12, (2022); Nurhasan U., Prasetyo A., Lazuardi G., Erfan R., Pradibta H., Implementation IoT in System Monitoring Hydroponic Plant Water Circulation and Control, International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 7, pp. 122-126, (2018); Srbinovska M., Gavrovski C., Dimcev V., Krkoleva A., Borozan V., Environmental parameters monitoring in precision agriculture using wireless sensor networks, Journal of Cleaner Production, 88, pp. 297-307, (2015); Pekel E., Estimation of soil moisture using decision tree regression, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 139, pp. 1111-1119, (2019); Calvet J.-C., Noilhan J., Bessemoulin P., Retrieving the Root-Zone Soil Moisture from Surface Soil Moisture or Temperature Estimates: A Feasibility Study Based on Field Measurements, Journal of Applied Meteorology (1988-2005), 37, pp. 371-386, (1998); Lee C.-C., An IoT Application for Growing Condition Monitoring at Citrus Orchard, Master dissertation, Inst. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, (2021); Liaw D.-C., Huang C.-R., Lee H.-T., Kumar S., A Case Study of Structural Health Monitoring by Using Wireless Sensor Networks, Ambient Communications and Computer Systems.

Studies have shown this is due to insufficient cognition of the structural relationship between data and events. Shili Theory is an attractive concept. To embed intelligent agricultural technology in events and the natural environment, especially to unify and standardize agricultural production data, firstly, this paper has defined the concept of Shili Theory which researches the natural regularity of the event by Shili Mirrored Structure. Secondly, this paper has proposed a Shili Mirrored Structure based on the technology development path (from the human brain memory mechanism to the information storage mechanism to intelligent technology). Finally, the structure has been applied to develop an intelligent system of agricultural production data management. In rice production of Jilin Province, it forms the event chain of the whole plant 5T (seed, seeding, paddy shoot, grain, product period operation) and grain period 5T (harvesting, field stacking, drying, warehousing, storing). The system application shows that this management structure can reduce data flow, improve data utilization, and enhance the correlation between data and events. It can realize the quality improvement of the agricultural production process, especially revealing the 8.83% significant latent loss in rice harvest. © 2023 by the authors.","data management; event; natural regularity; Shili Theory; smart farming; systematic thinking","","","","","","Chinese Academy of Engineering, CAE, (2019-XZ-71)","This research was funded by The Consultation Research Project Of The Chinese Academy Of Engineering, grant number 2019-XZ-71.","Ray D.K., Mueller N.D., West P.C., Foley J.A., Yield trends are insufficient to double global crop production by 2050, PLoS ONE, 8, (2013); Wezel A., Casagrande M., Celette F., Vian J.F., Ferrer A., Peigne J., Agroecological practices for sustainable agriculture.

For its part, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of managing the agri-food supply chain to ensure the food that the population needs. Industry 4.0 and its extensions can address the needs of the agri-food supply chain by bringing new features such as security, transparency and traceability in line with sustainable development goals. This study aims to systematically analyze the literature to address the challenges and barriers against the application of industry 4.0 and its related technologies in the management of an agri-food supply chain. Currently, despite the large number of publications, there is no clear agreement on what Industry 4.0 is, and even less its extensions. The next revolution that includes new technologies and improves several existing technologies brings additional conceptual and practical complexity. Consequently, in this work we first determine the main components of I 4.0 and their extensions by studying the literature, and then, in the second step, define the agri-food supply chain on which I 4.0 technologies are applied. Two well-known databases—Web of Science and Scopus—were chosen to extract data for the systematic review of the literature. For the final evaluation, we identified 24 of 100 reviewed publications. The results provide an exhaustive analysis of the different I 4.0 technologies and their extensions that are applied in regards to the agri-food supply chain. In addition, we find 15 challenges that are classified into five major themes in the agri-food supply chain: technical, operational, financial, social and infrastructure. The four most important challenges identified are technological architecture, security and privacy, big data management and IoT (internet)-based infrastructure. Only a few articles addressed sustainability, which reaffirms and demonstrates a considerable gap in terms of the sustainable agri-food supply chain, with waste management being the one that has attracted the most attention. This review provides a roadmap for academics and practitioners alike, showing the gaps and facilitating the identification of I 4.0 technologies that can help address the challenges facing the efficient management of an agri-food supply chain. © 2023 by the authors.","agri-food 4.0; agri-food 4.0 supply chain; agri-food supply chain; agriculture 4.0; food waste management; industry 4.0; supply chain 4.0; sustainability; water management","COVID-19; data management; literature review; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal; waste management; water management","","","","","","","Kang H.S., Lee J.Y., Choi S., Kim H., Park J.H., Son J.Y., Kim B.H., Noh S.D., Smart manufacturing: Past research, present findings, and future directions, Int.

However, the main applications are focused on data management and monitoring of crop fields, so agricultural processes such as planting and harvesting are not yet fully automated. A clear example of this occurs in the cultivation of rice, which despite being one of the most important agricultural products in the world, the manual production method continues to predominate in developing countries. This work presents a design of an autonomous terrestrial vehicle capable of carrying out the rice transplantation process, having as its main characteristics its ability to move in the field of cultivation at a speed of 0.75m/s, transport a payload of up to 20kg and possess an autonomy of 1 hour. Which translates into an effective field capacity (EFC) of 0.21 ha/h, an operational equivalence of 7 workers/hour and an increase in the productivity of the transplant process of 200% with respect to the manual process. It seeks to provide farmers in developing countries with an affordable option, supported by numerical simulations, with which they can obtain the benefits of precision agriculture in the process of transplanting rice. In such a way, that the manual production of rice and its disadvantages such as low productivity, the physical consequences for the farmers and the limitations against expensive machinery are replaced by the automation proposal. © 2023 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

Smart agriculture, based on the Internet of Things (IoT), represents a significant evolution in the agricultural sector, optimizing agricultural processes, improving productivity, and fostering sustainability. In the absence of a national data center, the Central African Backbone Fiber Optic Project (CAB) aims to support the emergence of a digital economy in the Central African Republic. The deployment of a data center at the University of Bangui is being considered, with the synergistic use of VXLAN and SDN to enhance agricultural efficiency. This innovative approach facilitates connectivity, data management, and collaboration within smart agricultural ecosystems. Expected impacts include the implementation of a data center for the University of Bangui, addressing capacity constraints for the training of agricultural engineers, and the transmission of scientific and technical knowledge. Ultimately, this solution aims to enable engineers to contribute to improving agricultural productivity by applying the skills acquired through online training and the Internet of Things.  © 2024 IEEE.","Data center; IoT; online learning; SDN; Smart agriculture; VXLAN","Agriculture; E-learning; Ecosystems; Engineers; Information management; Personnel training; Regional planning; Agricultural sector; Case-studies; Central African Republic; Datacenter; LAN technologies; Online learning; Rural development; Smart agricultures; Software-defined networkings; Virtual extensible LAN; Internet of things","","","","","","","Shif L., Wang F., Lung C.-H., Improvement of security and scalability for IoT network using SD-VPN, NOMS 2018-2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 1-5, (2018); Oguchi N., Sekiya M., Virtual data planes for easy creation and operation of end-to-end virtual networks, 2017 25th InternationalConference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM), pp. 1-6, (2017); Diouf S., Gueye K., Ouya S., Mendy G., Proposal for a solution to improve access to mathematics and philosophy education in Senegal thanks to SDN and IPTV, 2020 22nd International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT), pp. 566-570, (2020); Traistaru C., VXLAN-A practical approach to cloud computing scalability, 2023 22nd RoEduNet Conference: Networking in Education and Research (RoEduNet), pp. 1-4, (2023); Guide de l'utilisateur EVPN, Juniper Networks, (2023); Naranjo E.F., H C Salazar G.D., Underlay and overlay networks: The approach to solve addressing and segmentation problems in the new networking era: VXLAN encapsulation with Cisco and open source networks, 2017 IEEE Second Ecuador Technical Chapters Meeting (ETCM), pp. 1-6, (2017); El Sayed Fathy Ahmed A., Elsayed H.A., Performance Comparison of SDN Wireless Network Under Floodlight and POX Controllers, 2022 13th International Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEENG), pp. 91-95, (2022); Zakurdaev G., Ismail M., Lung C.-H., Dynamic On-Demand Virtual Extensible LAN Tunnels via Software-Defined Wide Area Networks, 2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), pp. 995-1000, (2022); Santhanamahalingam S., Alagarsamy S., Subramanian K., A study of cloud-based VPN establishment using network function virtualization technique, 2022 3rd International Conference on Smart Electronics and Communication (ICOSEC), pp. 627-631, (2022); Mohan K.V.M., Kodati S., Krishna V., Securing SDN Enabled IoT Scenario Infrastructure of Fog Networks From Attacks, 2022 Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Energy (ICAIS), pp. 1239-1243, (2022); SafaeiSisakht M., Hsu C.-H., Hsu P.-Y., Chen M.-Y., An Intelligent Two-Phase Automated Architecture for Securing SDNBased IoT Infrastructure, 2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electronic Communications, Internet of Things and Big Data (ICEIB), pp. 12-16, (2023); Wei M., Liang E., Nie Z., A SDN-based IoT Fine-grained Access Control Method, 2020 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN), pp. 637-642, (2020); Yoon H., Kim S., Nam T., Kim J., Dynamic flow steering for IoT monitoring data in SDN-coordinated IoT-Cloud services, 2017 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN), pp. 625-627, (2017); Zhao Z., Hong F., Li R., SDN Based VxLAN Optimization in Cloud Computing Networks, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 23312-23319, (2017); Wang S., Neupane R., Pandey A., Cheng X., Calyam P., Online Learning Platform for Application-Inspired Cloud and DevOps Curriculum, (2023)","E.

It is vital to manage and conduct analytical tasks on the raster data. Existing solutions employ dedicated systems for the raster data management and processing, respectively, incurring problems such as data redundancy, difficulty in updating, expensive data transferring and transformation, etc. To cope with these limitations, this demonstration presents Ganos Aero, a cloud-native system for big raster data management and processing. Ganos Aero proposes a unified raster data model for both the data management and processing, which stores a single copy of the raster data and without performing an expensive tiling procedure, and thus achieves significant improvement in the storage and updating efficiency. To enable efficient query and batch task processing, Ganos Aero implements an on-the-fly tile production mechanism, and optimizes its performance using the cloud features including decoupling compute from storage and pushing costly operations closer to the storage layer. Since deployed in Alibaba Cloud in 2022, Ganos Aero has been playing a critical role in many real applications including the modern agriculture, environment monitoring and protection, et al. © 2023, VLDB Endowment.

However, the enormous antibiotic usage in agriculture especially for livestock leads to considerable quantities of antibiotic residues in associated food products and can reach potentially hazardous levels for consumers. Therefore, timely detection and systematical surveillance on residual antibiotics in food materials are of significance to minimize the negative impact caused by such unwanted antibiotic leftovers. To this end, we constructed a cloud-platform-based system (ARSCP) for comprehensive surveillance of antibiotic residues in food materials. With the system, we collected 126,560 samples from 68 chicken farms across China and detected the antibiotic residues using a rapid detection colorimetric commercial (Explorer 2.0) kit and UPLC-MS/MS. Only 108 (0.085 %) of the samples contained residual antibiotics exceeding the MRLs and all data were subjected to ARSCP system to provide a landscape of antibiotic residues in China. As a proof-of-concept, we provided an overview of residual antibiotics based on data from China, but the system is generally applicable to track and monitor the antibiotic residues globally when the data from other countries are incorporated. We used the combined Explorer 2.0 and MS data to construct ARSCP, an antimicrobial residue surveillance cloud platform for raw chicken samples. ARSCP can be used for rapid detection and real-time monitoring of antibiotic residues in animal food and provides both data management and risk warning functions. This system provides a solution to improve the management of facilities that must monitor antibiotic MRLs in food animal products that can reduce the pollution of antibiotics to the environment. © 2022","Antimicrobial residue; Data management; Detection; Monitoring; Risk warning","Animal Feed; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Chromatography, Liquid; Cloud Computing; Disease Progression; Humans; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; China; Agriculture; Animals; Food products; Information management; Microorganisms; Monitoring; Veterinary medicine; antibiotic agent; chloramphenicol; doxycycline; florfenicol; sulfamonomethoxine; thiamphenicol; antiinfective agent; Animal health; Animal-derived food; Antibiotic residues; Antimicrobial residue; Cloud platforms; Detection; Food materials; Human health; Rapid detection; Risk warnings; antibiotics; data management; detection method; livestock; risk assessment; agricultural land; animal derived food; animal experiment; animal product; animal tissue; antimicrobial residue; Article; breeding; broiler; chicken meat; China; cloud computing; colorimetry; controlled study; electrospray; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false positive result; food industry; Gallus gallus; mass spectrometry; monitoring; nonhuman; quality control; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; waste; animal; animal food; disease exacerbation; human; liquid chromatography; tandem mass spectrometry; Antibiotics","","chloramphenicol, 134-90-7, 2787-09-9, 56-75-7; doxycycline, 10592-13-9, 17086-28-1, 564-25-0, 94088-85-4; florfenicol, 73231-34-2; sulfamonomethoxine, 1220-83-3; thiamphenicol, 15318-45-3; Anti-Bacterial Agents, ; Anti-Infective Agents, ","","","Guang Dong Provincial Science and Technology Special Fund Project, (2019B020401); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2020B0301030007); Innovation Team Project of Guangdong University, (2019KCXTD001); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China, (IRT_17R39); WENS Foodstuff Group; Guangdong Provincial Pearl River Talents Program, (2019BT02N054); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (32121004, WENS-2021-1-ZDSC-009); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (D20008)","This work was supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research ( 2020B0301030007 ), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32121004 ), Scientific Research Major Project (WENS-2021-1-ZDSC-009) from the WENS Foodstuff Group, Guang Dong Provincial Science and Technology Special Fund Project ( 2019B020401 ), Local Innovative and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program ( 2019BT02N054 ), Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China ( IRT_17R39 ), Innovation Team Project of Guangdong University ( 2019KCXTD001 ) and the 111 Project ( D20008 ).

The latter emerging technologies for food safety monitoring show great promise for ensuring the quality and suitability of food. Being non-destructive and quantitative as well as rapid and automated, they generate large amounts of data. However, because this is a relatively young field and given the large variety of measurement methods, types of sensors and devices available, so far there exist no data standards to enable data sharing and interoperability between data collections. Therefore, much of this data remains inaccessible in separate laboratories and research institutions limiting the community's ability to develop comprehensive data driven predictive analysis and monitoring models. In the context of the Horizon 2020 DiTECT project, we have developed semantically enabled software systems for standardized data management to enable data sharing and data analytics by stakeholders in the food safety sector. In this paper, we present DiTECT food safety ontology for covering food safety analysis technologies and methods for noninvasive and rapid assessment of safety and authenticity of food products. The ontology maximally reuses well-known concepts from widely used reference ontologies related to the domains of measurement, agriculture, food and biochemical analysis. Our expectation is that our ontology will become a key, publicly accessible resource for enabling the use of data science in food safety sector. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Combining the IPFS and blockchain technology could alleviate the pressure on blockchain storage. The distinct features of the supply chain for agricultural products in the plantation industry, including extended production cycles, multiple, heterogeneous data sources, and relatively fragmented production, which can readily result in information gaps and opacity throughout the supply chain; in the traceability process of agricultural products, there are issues with sensitive data being prone to leakage and a lack of security, and the supply chain of plantation agricultural products is long, and the traceability data is often stored in multiple blocks, which requires frequent block tracing operations during tracing, resulting in low efficiency. Consequently, the aim of this study is to fully encapsulate the decentralized nature of blockchain, safeguard the privacy of sensitive data, and alleviate the storage strain of blockchain. [Method] A traceability model for plantation-based agricultural products was developed, leveraging the hyperledger fabric consortium chain and the IPFS. Based on data type, traceability data was categorized into structured and unstructured data. Given that blockchain ledgers were not optimized for direct storage of unstructured data, such as images and videos, to alleviate the storage strain on the blockchain, unstructured data was persisted in the IPFS, while structured data remains within the blockchain ledger. Based on data privacy categories, traceability data was categorized into public data and sensitive data. Public data was stored in the public ledger of hyperledger fabric, while sensitive data was stored in the private data collection of hyperledger fabric. This method allowed for efficient data access while maintaining data security, enhancing the efficiency of traceability. Hyperledger Fabric was the foundational platform for the development of the prototype system. The front-end website was based on the TCP/IP protocol stack. The website visualization was implemented through the React framework. Smart contracts were crafted using the Java programming language. The performance of the application layer interface was tested using the testing tool Postman. [Conclusions and Discussions] The blockchain-based plantation agricultural product traceability system was structured into a five-tiered architecture, starting from the top: the application layer, gateway layer, contract layer, consensus layer, and data storage layer. The primary service providers at the application layer were the enterprises and consumers involved in each stage of the traceability process. The gateway layer served as the middleware between users and the blockchain, primarily providing interface support for the front-end interface of the application layer. The contract layer mainly included smart contracts for planting, processing, warehousing, transportation, and sales. The consensus layer used the EtcdRaft consensus algorithm. The data storage layer was divided into the on-chain storage layer of the blockchain ledger and the off-chain storage layer of the IPFS cluster. In terms of data types, each piece of traceability data was categorized into structured data items and unstructured data items. Unstructured data was stored in the Interstellar File System cluster, and the returned content identifiers were integrated with the structured data items into the blockchain nodes within the traceability system. In the realm of data privacy, smart contracts were employed to segregate public and sensitive data, with public data directly integrating onto the blockchain, and sensitive data, adhering to predefined sharing policies, being stored in a private dataset designated by hyperledger fabric. In terms of user queries, consumers could retrieve product traceability information via a traceability system overseen by a reputable authority. The developed model website consisted of three parts: a login section, an agricultural product circulation information management and user data management section for enterprises in various links, and a traceability data query section for consumers. When using synchronous and asynchronous Application Program Interfaces, the average data on-chain latency was 2 138.9 and 37.6 ms, respectively, and the average data query latency was 12.3 ms. Blockchain, as the foundational data storage technology, enhances the credibility and transaction efficiency in agricultural product traceability. [Conclusions] This study designed and implemented a plantation agricultural product traceability model leveraging blockchain technology's private dataset and the IPFS cluster. This model ensured secure sharing and storage of traceability data, particularly sensitive data, across all stages. Compared to traditional centralized traceability models, it enhanced the reliability of the traceability data. Based on the evaluation through experimental systems, the traceability model proposed in this study effectively safeguarded the privacy of sensitive data in enterprises. Additionally, it offered high efficiency in data linking and querying. Applicable to the real-world traceability environment of plantation agricultural products, it showed potential for widespread application and promotion, offering fresh insights for designing blockchain traceability models in this sector. The model is still in its experimental phase and lacks applications across various types of crops in the farming industry. The subsequent step is to apply the model in real-world scenarios, continually enhance its efficiency, refine the model, advance the practical application of blockchain technology, and lay the foundation for agricultural modernization. © 2024 Chinese Journal of Nursing Education.

In this advanced technical era, the Internet of Things (IoT) and various electronic instruments (such as robots and artificial intelligence components) with data transformation and signaling facilities are now revolutionizing the agriculture sector. Nowadays, farmers can leverage IoT to enhance their farming conditions such as in areas like irrigation and fertilization, as well as increase the efficiency by using data from harvesting information, and projecting climate forecasts to improve their decision making. One of the key challenges in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity from multiple data sources. As such, ontology is regarded as one of the normative tools that is suitable to solve the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, sharing, and making the domains’ knowledge explicit. In the field of smart farming, several ontologies have been developed. For example, soil-based farming methods have been further developed to represent and store the essential knowledge of aquaponics. Unfortunately, how these ontologies support the SF context is not well understood. This article reviews the recent available ontologies for smart farming. From the review, we discuss some key points from an ontology engineering point of view on the state-of-the-art ontologies for SF that should be designed and developed. Moreover, we add some key important remarks on the direction to further explore potential areas of ontologies for supporting smart farming operations. © 2023 Proceedings of the 16th IADIS International Conference on Information Systems 2023, IS 2023.

Since the entire agricultural sector is an essential component of food production, high standards of resilience should be established in the involved companies. Accordingly, the used software should also be designed with high standards on reliability and crisis capability. Based on a literature review, we found that software for farmers with certain resilience needs is lacking. Thus, we designed and evaluated a new FMIS concept with the user-centred design method. By conducting focus groups (two rounds, total N = 57) in 2017 and 2019, we raised specific front-end and back-end requirements of farmers. Based on the requirements, we developed our concept for both front- and back-end in terms of a decentralised and offline-working FMIS. Through the evaluation with practitioners (N = 16) of the implemented concept, we derived findings and implications, highlighting the need for privacy, stability, and offline-capability, as well as the UI-requirement to be supportive, e.g. with easy to understand icons and terms. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dezentralised data management; Digitalisation and resilience in agriculture; farm management information systems; human–computer interaction; system usability evaluation","Farms; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Information use; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Decentralised; Dezentralised data management; Digitalization and resilience in agriculture; Farm management; Farm management information system; High standards; Offline; System usability; System usability evaluation; Usability evaluation; agricultural worker; agriculture; article; human; human computer interaction; major clinical study; physician; privacy; software; usability; user-centered design; Information management","","","","","AgriRegio; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01IS17030B, 2021, 2022); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank","This work was supported by funds of the German Government's Special Purpose Fund held at Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank in the projects Geobox-II and AgriRegio, and by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the project HyServ [01IS17030B].

Because of size, cost, and manufacturing advantages, solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SCISEs) were fabricated as an ion sensor array and interfaced with wireless embedded-systems to construct an IoT nutrient sensor system (IoNSS) for the first time. The entire IoNSS framework was composed of (i) a nutrient solution sampling and sensing module with SCISEs controlled by an Arduino Due® microcontroller, (ii) a Wio Terminal® microcontroller for automated procedure setting, data recording, and wireless transmission, (iii) a private cloud server (a Network Attached Storage equipped with Node-RED® and MongoDB®) for data management, and (iv) MQTT webpage-based interactive interfaces. In experiments, we found that potentiometric signal resolution and noise of the Arduino-interfaced SCISEs were significantly improved and approached to instrumental DAQ-like quality by additional delta-sigma ADC (ADS1115®) chip conditioning. This facilitated cost-effective harvest of precise and high-quality IoT ion sensor data. Before on-site applications, each SCISE was two-point calibrated in multiple-ion solutions and was checked with the fixed interference method. The ion concentration measurements were also compared with those of commercial ISEs and ion chromatography. To test the system's feasibility, the IoNSS was applied to cyber-monitoring of K+, NO3–, and NH4+ concentrations during two-week hydroponic cultivation of arugula (E. vesicaria) in an indoor plant factory (in Northern Taiwan) with a modified Cornell solution and an outdoor greenhouse (in Southern Taiwan) with a modified Yamasaki solution, respectively. It was demonstrated that the IoNSS was capable of real-time observation of the crop's nitrate/ammonium utilization and nutrient solution's EC-element dependency. Besides, the web interfaces successfully reported growing condition-dependent ion signals in a simultaneous and remote manner. To sum up, this work achieves novel cybermonitoring of element-specific nutrients by IoT-interfaced SCISEs and paves a promising way for intelligent hydroponic management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Hydroponics; Internet of things (IoT); Nutrient management; Precision agriculture; Solid-contact ion-selective electrode (SCISE); Wireless sensors","Taiwan; Analog to digital conversion; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Electrochemical sensors; Embedded systems; Information management; Internet of things; Ion chromatography; Ion selective electrodes; Ions; Microcontrollers; Nutrients; Precision agriculture; Element specific; Internet of thing; Ion-selective electrode; Ion-sensors; Nutrient management; Precision Agriculture; Sensor systems; Solid contacts; Solid-contact ion-selective electrode; Wireless sensor; array; electrode; hydroponics; information; Internet; precision agriculture; sampling; sensor; Hydroponics","","","","","Council of Agriculture, COA, (111AS-8.3.2-ST-a3)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, ROC. under the grant numbers of 111AS-8.3.2-ST-a3 . ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, ROC. under the grant numbers of 111AS-8.3.2-ST-a3.","Bamsey M., Graham T., Thompson C., Berinstain A., Scott A., Dixon M., Ion-Specific Nutrient Management in Closed Systems: The Necessity for Ion-Selective Sensors in Terrestrial and Space-Based Agriculture and Water Management Systems, Sensors (basel, Switzerland), 12, 10, pp. 13349-13392, (2012); Bonasia A., Lazzizera C., Elia A., Conversa G., Nutritional, Biophysical and Physiological Characteristics of Wild Rocket Genotypes as Affected by Soilless Cultivation System, Salinity Level of Nutrient Solution and Growing Period, Front.

Digital twins have become the buzzword in the domain of digital transformation. These Digital twins, which are a virtual representation of real-world occurrences such as processes, services, or products offer a new perspective to digitalization. It has emerged from Industry 4.0 and involves a mapping of the real physical world and the virtual world through Digital Twinning. Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, Blockchain, Big Data technologies, and IoT act as technology enablers for Digital Twins. The capability of Digital Twin is its ability to cater to diverse applications. Within a decade, it has penetrated deeply into every functional aspect of business right from Patient Health Information Systems to remote control and maintenance of satellites/ space stations and to agriculture. This chapter has a focus on the key attributes, challenges, and risk factors that pertain to digital twin technologies and provides adequate examples from diverse sectors. The key challenges of digital twin technologies include Modeling the unknown, Transparency, Interpretability, Interactions with physical assets, Large-scale computation, Physical realism, Future projections, Data management, Privacy, Security and Quality. The four facets of risks related to Digital Twins include restrictions in access to system resources, theft of intellectual property, lack of compliance, and integrity issues in data/information. Hence, additional efforts and a holistic approach towards privacy and security are required to manage these risks. The holistic approach should cover hardware, software, and firmware together with the information that passes between them. Further, it is required to ensure that system, assets and data are adequately protected. Digital Twin technologies provide enormous competitive advantage for an organization, and a more pragmatic approach for mitigation of risks associated with digital twins is required. This would involve co-creation of Digital Twins with clients along with combined extensive knowledge of physical assets, disruptive technologies and appropriate security measures. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This paper defines the connotation and characteristics of the green development of the whole agricultural industry chain and deeply analyzes the development status, major challenges, and feasible paths of the whole agricultural industry chain in China. It has built a whole industry chain development model of ""Internet + modern agriculture""and proposed a decentralized agricultural data management system based on the IoT to solve the problem of untraceable of traditional agricultural products and other data. The agricultural IoT system is designed with a unique blockchain double-chain structure, using the global hash chain and the mutual verification between the transaction chains in each partition. It proposes the PMCP protocol, which improves the performance of the system by producing blocks in parallel for several consensus groups in each consensus cycle. The experimental results show that the proposed model is queryable, traceable, and trustworthy for whole-life agricultural data, and the proposed model outperforms other schemes in terms of throughput and delay.  © 2022 Jing Wang.","","Agricultural technology; Competition; Ecology; Information management; Internet of things; Sustainable development; Agricultural industries; Decentralised; Development model; Development path; Development status; Ecological environments; Industry chain; Modern agricultures; Resources utilizations; Sustainable economic development; Agricultural products","","","","","","","Yi X., Lin D., Li J., Zeng J., Wang D., Yang F., Ecological treatment technology for agricultural non-point source pollution in remote rural areas of China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 30, pp. 40075-40087, (2021); Lu Y., Norse D., Powlson D.S., Agriculture Green Development in China and the UK: Common objectives and converging policy pathways[J], Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 98-105, (2019); Strokal M., Janssen A.B.G., Chen X., Kroeze C., Li F., Ma L., Yu H., Zhang F., Wang M., Green agriculture and blue water in China: Reintegrating crop and livestock production for clean water, Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering, 8, 1, pp. 72-80, (2021); Gravey V., Finally free to green agriculture policy?

However, the lack of innovation in agricultural technology and the limited distribution channels for crop yields have caused farmers' welfare levels to be relatively low in various regions. Meanwhile, Smart Agriculture and 4.0 Technologies play a considerable role in increasing the agricultural sector's efficiency. Digitalization has had a significant influence on transforming traditional agricultural systems into data management-based approaches. The Desa Apps is an open access agricultural extension platform developed in Indonesia that facilitates farmers to interact with other farmers to share ideas, innovations, and solutions to face various farm and off-farm obstacles. This paper aims to describe the development platform and identify opportunities related to developing the Desa Apps platform. The results showed that Java and Sumatra islands have good potential for developing the Desa Apps platform. Besides, the registered members with the most significant reporting level are farmers, extension agents, and traders. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación, ANII; Bundesministerium für Forschung und Technologie, BMFT","This research was supported by the Ministry of Research and Technology / National Agency for Research and Innovation (Kementerian Riset dan Teknologi/ Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional) through funding the Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi (PDUPT) funding plan for the 2020 budget year.","Klerkx L, Jakku E, Labarthe P, A review of social science on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0: New contributions and a future research agenda NJAS-Wageningen, Journal of Life Sciences, pp. 90-91, (2019); Annosi M C, Brunetta F, Monti A, Nat F, Is the trend your friend?

Good farm resources management via recent technologies is pursued here in this proposed work such as effective water usage, decreasing human labor, and reducing efforts and errors due to human carelessness. This leads to improve the overall efficiency and work accuracy of the green farm. Smart farming could be realized using modern management technologies to increase the quantity and quality of the farm goods. New available technologies such as sensors for water and temperature could be used in this sort of works. In addition to the advanced microcontrollers that could give precise data management about the farm. Also, solar cells technologies for clean and saving used power in the green farm. This proposed smart, cheap, and accurate farming system could be a good solution for current agriculture challenges. © 2020 IEEE.","efficient farming; low-cost system; modern technologies; smart farming; solar cells","Information management; Farming system; Human labor; Low costs; Modern management; Overall efficiency; Resources management; Water usage; Agricultural robots","","","","","","","Xue-FenWan Z.T., Cui J., Zhang F., Ma Z., Yang Y., Near field communication-based agricultural management service systems for family farms, Sensors, 19, (2019); Muangprathuba J., Boonnama N., Kajornkasirata S., Lekbangponga N., Wanichsombata A., Nillaorb P., IoT and agriculture data analysis for smart farm, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 156, pp. 467-474, (2018); Lin Y., Lin Y., Lin J., Hung H., Sensortalk: An IoT device failure detection and calibration mechanism for smart farming, Sensors, 19, (2019); Nayyar A., Vikram Puri Er., Smart farming: IoT based smart sensors agriculture stick for live temprature and moisture monitoring using arduino, cloud computing & solar technology, The International Conference on Communication and Computing Systems (ICCCS-2016), (2016); Yoon C., Huh M., Kang S., Park J., Lee C., Implement smart farm with IoT technology, International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology (ICACT), (2018); Srinivasa Rao K., Nagendra N., Automatic watering of an expressional gardening system, International Journal of Electronics, Electrical and Computational System, 6, (2017); Singh Bains P., Kumar Jindal R., Kaur Channi H., Modeling and designing of automatic plant watering system using arduino, International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology, 3, (2017); Ebrahimi M.A., Khoshtaghaza M.H., Minaei S., Jamshidi B., Vision-based pest detection based on SVM classification method, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 137, (2017); Kloosterman L., Mager K., Pheromone trap, Chapter: Pest Control in Food Businesses: An Introduction, Hygiene in Food Processing, (2014); Sun Y., Liu X., Yuan M., Ren L., Wang J., Chen Z., Automatic in-trap pest detection using deep learning for pheromone-based Dendroctonus valens monitoring, Biosystems Engineering, 176, pp. 140-150, (2018); Padalalu P., Mahajan S., Dabir K., Mitkar S., Javale D., Smart water dripping system for agriculture/farming, International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT), (2017); Hamuda E., Mc Ginley B., Glavin M., Jones E., Automatic crop detection under field conditions using the HSV colour space and morphological operations, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 133, pp. 97-107, (2017); Boschetti M., Busetto L., Manfron G., Laborte A., Asilo S., Pazhanivelan S., Nelson A., PhenoRice: A method for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal information on rice crops using satellite data time series, Remote Sensing of Environment, 194, pp. 347-365, (2017); Amandeep B.A., Das P., Basu D., Smart farming using IoT, 8th IEEE Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON), (2017); Grokhotkov I., ESP8266 Arduino Core Documentation, (2015); Sushanth G., Sujatha S., IoT based smart agriculture system, International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET), (2018); Dagar R., Som S., Kumar Khatri S., Smart farming-iot in agriculture, International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA 2018), (2018); Brahma Chary R., Naga Sujatha K., Gondesi A., Power quality enhancement for flexible operation of grid integrated wind farm with STATCOM, IJEETC, 2, 4, (2013); Petersen B., Bindner H., Poulsen B., You S., Smart grid communication infrastructure comparison-for distributed control of distributed energy resources using internet of things devices, IJEETC, 7, 1, (2018); Vishnu Kumar M., Jayapriya J., Nirmala Devi S., Dhanalakshmi N., Convergence of Green and Smart Buildings Based on Green Computing, 3, 3, (2014)","M.T.

The field of ‘usable security’ already started to emerge in the mid-90s, primarily focussed on password and email security. Later on, the research field of ”usable security and privacy” evolved and broadened the aim to design concepts and tools to assist users in enhancing their behaviour with regard to both privacy and security. Nevertheless, many user interventions are not as effective as desired. Because of highly diverse usage contexts, leading to different privacy and security requirements and not always to one-size-fits-all approaches, tailorability is necessary to address this issue. Furthermore, transparency is a crucial requirement, as providing comprehensible information may counter reactance towards security interventions. This article first provides a brief history of the research field in its first quarter-century and then highlights research on the transparency and tailorability of user interventions. Based on this, this article then presents six contributions with regard to (1) privacy concerns in times of COVID-19, (2) authentication on mobile devices, (3) GDPR-compliant data management, (4) privacy notices on websites, (5) data disclosure scenarios in agriculture, as well as (6) rights under data protection law and the concrete process should data subjects want to claim those rights. This article concludes with several research directions on user-centred transparency and tailorability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","intervention mechanisms; security and privacy literacy; transparency-enhancing technologies; usable privacy; Usable security","","","","","","Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and the Arts; National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (236615297, SFB1119); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (16KIS1508); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","This research work has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, 16KIS1508) and the Hessian Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and the Arts within their joint support of the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE, by the Centre Responsible Digitality and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)–SFB1119: CROSSING (236615297), and Accountable AI (471168026).

Little is currently known of the potential role of the emerging digital technologies in furthering the sustainability of supermarket chains in emerging economies. Thus, an original multiple case study has been conducted, involving six supermarket chains operating in Brazil and six farming distributors that produce fruit and vegetables (F&V). The findings show that actions towards food waste reduction based on the principles of the circular economy begin with an understanding of F&V stages of deterioration. Through such an understanding, a number of actions can be undertaken to reduce the negative effects of this deterioration. These include (among others) the management of prices, sales, operations, and purchases, all of which can be underpinned by such technologies as sensors and augmented reality in order to manage dynamic pricing, storage, and item display. The findings contribute to demonstrating how digital technologies can help supermarkets’ marketing departments in driving corporate sustainability while also benefiting both consumers and societal well-being. © 2021","Big data; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Green marketing; Sustainability; Sustainable operations","Brazil; Augmented reality; Big data; Costs; Deterioration; Digital storage; Predictive analytics; Sales; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Emerging economies; Food waste; Fruit and vegetables; Green marketing; Marketing strategy; Multiple-case study; Supermarket chains; Sustainable operations; corporate strategy; data management; developing world; food waste; information and communication technology; marketing; supermarket; sustainability; Retail stores","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (23/2018)","The authors would like to thank CNPq (edital 23/2018) for the financial support of the research.

However, challenges still exist in technology implementation, which mainly involves biased points of view, initially higher costs, uncertainty, lack of transparency, and trust. To tackle these challenges, recent research attempts to introduce blockchain technology, combined with ICT, to promote sustainable e-agriculture. Blockchain technology, due to its distributed network system, is believed to enable a more transparent supply chain and rebuild trust between members. Therefore, blockchain-enabled e-agriculture is widely considered as the next step towards sustainable agriculture. Realistically, implementing blockchain technology still offers some key issues, and a new perspective about sustainable data management systems is needed. In this paper, data demands from all related parties who care about sustainability achievements in the agricultural sector are taken into consideration. The paper proposes an overall system approach to insert blockchain technology into the current agri-food supply chain. It provides interesting insights about how to achieve sustainability, by creating a new value mechanism among blockchain network members. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain technology; data management approach; e-agriculture; sustainability","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Blockchain; Food supply; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agri-food supply chains; Agricultural sector; Data management system; Distributed network systems; Recent researches; Sustainable agriculture; System approach; Technology implementation; Information management","","","","","","","Nayak G., Dhaigude A.S., A conceptual model of sustainable supply chain management in small and medium enterprises using blockchain technology, Cogent Econ.

This sort of transducer is utilized to decide the amount of each of these elements additionally required as external supplements to the soil for soil richness. This assists by improving soil quality and reduce the utilization of fertilizers that are not required. The incident light of every supplement chooses the example's N, P, and K value. The optical transducer is executed as a light source with three LEDs and a photodiode as a detecting component in a recognition sensor. The frequencies of LEDs are picked to compare to every supplement's retention band. The supplement retains the light from the LED, which is then changed by the photodiode. Since the gadget gathers information utilizing a Boltduino microcontroller, the information from the transducer is sent to the cloud for processing with the help of IoT technology. This Design used blockchain technology and data management to render fertilizer sales only when the field's NPK levels are low. Here made a Decentralized app (Graphical user Interface) at PoS, point of sale. Since it is linked to the cloud and uses blockchain technology, promise transparency at its best. As a result, every penny of fertilizer subsidy provided by the government benefits farmers. It also cuts down on the amount of fertilizer generated, supplied, and used. Hence soils are saved from overuse of fertilizers and groundwater nitrogen pollution is reduced. © 2022 IEEE.","Blockchain; Decentralized app; Internet of things; NPK; Optical transducer","Agriculture; Graphical user interfaces; Groundwater; Information management; Internet of things; Light emitting diodes; Photodiodes; Transducers; Block-chain; Chain systems; Decentralised; Decentralized app; Incident light; N value; NPK; Optical transducers; P-values; Soils qualities; Soils","","","","","","","Ahmed U., Lin J.C.W., Srivastava G., Djenouri Y., A nutrient recommendation system for soil fertilization based on evolutionary computation, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 189, (2021); Agarwal S., Bhangale N., Dhanure K., Gavhane S., Chakkarwar V.A., Nagori M.B., Application of colorimetry to determine soil fertility through naive bayes classification algorithm, 2018 9th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT), pp. 1-6, (2018); Edwin Prem Kumar G., Lydia M., Impact of Internet of Things in Agriculture, Proceedings of International Conference on Data Science and Applications, pp. 243-251, (2022); Masrie M., Syamim Aizuddin Rosman M., Sam R., Jani Z., Detection of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) nutrients of soil using Optical Transducer, Proc. of the 4th IEEE International Conference on Smart InstrumentationJ, (2017); Ellen M.N.R., Fadchar N.A., Cruz Dela J.C., Soil NPK Levels Characterization Using Near Infrared and Artificial Neural Network, 2020 16th IEEE International Colloquium on Signal Processing & its Applications, (2020); Sri Latha Jhansi A., NagaSai Manojna C., Padma Ashalesha C.N.L., Balamurugan K.S., Wearable Tag for Human Health Monitoring System, Inventive Computation and Information Technologies.

Decision support tools can use data management services and analytics to exploit data streams from farm and other economic, health, and agricultural sources. We will describe a decision support tool that couples data analytics tools to underlying cow, herd, and economic data with an application programming interface. This interface allows the user to interact with a collection of dairy applications without fully exposing the intricacies of the underlying system model and understand the effects of different decisions on outputs of interest. The collection of these applications will form the basis of the Dairy Brain decision support system, which will provide management suggestions to farmers at a single animal or farm level. Dairy operations data will be gathered, cleaned, organized, and disseminated through an agricultural data hub, exploiting newly developed ontologies for integration of multiple data sources. Models of feed efficiency, culling, or other dairy operations (such as large capital expenditures, outsourcing opportunities, and interactions with regulators) form the basis of analytical approaches, operationalized via tools that help secure information and control uncertainties. The applications will be independently generated to provide flexibility, and use tools and modeling approaches from the data science, simulation, machine learning, and optimization disciplines to provide specific recommendations to decision makers. The Dairy Brain is a decision support system that couples data analytics tools with a suite of applications that integrate cow, herd, and economic data to inform management, operational, and animal health improving practices. Research challenges that remain include dealing with increased variability as predictions go from herd or pen level down to individual cow level and choosing the appropriate tool or technique to deal with a specific problem. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","application programming interface; Dairy Brain; data management and decision support tools; machine learning and optimization","Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Data Science; Decision Making; Decision Support Techniques; Farmers; Female; User-Computer Interface; agricultural worker; agriculture; animal; bovine; computer interface; dairying; decision making; decision support system; economics; female; procedures","","","","","USDA-National Institute for Food and Agriculture; University of Wisconsin-Madison UW2020; Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy, FACT, (2018-09256)","This project has been supported by the University of Wisconsin-Madison UW2020 initiative that encourages highly innovative and groundbreaking research.

For countries producing agricultural commodities, the climate affects the quantity and quality of products. Many methods have been proposed to keep track of climate. One traditional method is the weather station model, which indicates the temperature, wind speed, and direction and extent of cloud cover. However, this method of predicting climate change has low accuracy due to geographical variation, for example, mountainous or forested areas. Recently, a combination of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and machine learning (ML) has been considered for prediction with the Internet of Things (IoT), for instance, through a wireless body area network. For climate change prediction, we design and develop a control system that uses node sensors to collect data in sandhills and beaches, with data management conducted via a web application with three components. The first component is designed to collect data from the node sensors. The second component is mainly used to control the system through a web application. The third component uses linear regression in ML to analyze the data to predict weight and volume. The complete system has been tried and tested in real time on a 10-m2 area of a beach at Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, where sensor node data were wirelessly collected over a cloud using a web application. This enabled assessment of the current state of the land at a coastal sandy beach, as well as prediction of the risk level of desertification and natural disasters. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","linear regression; machine learning; predict; sensor; web application; wireless sensor network","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Beaches; Data acquisition; Disasters; Forecasting; Information management; Internet of things; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Risk assessment; Sensor nodes; Wind; Agricultural commodities; Climate change prediction; Coastal sandy beaches; Geographical variations; Internet of thing (IOT); Natural disasters; Quality of product; Wireless body area network; Climate change","","","","","","","Nguyen T., (2020); Vietnam, (2020); Anne G., Le H., Pham L., Et al., Impact of global climate change and desertification on the environment and society in the southern centre of vietnam (Case Study in the Binh Thuan Province), (2013); Pham T., Le M., Hien trang xoi lo boi tu bo bien, Vietnam J Earth Sci, 33, 3, (2011); Le H., Anne G., Luc H., Risk assessment of desertification for binh thuan province, vietnam, Hum Ecol Risk Assess Int J, 16, pp. 1544-1556, (2014); Josephine Y., Sara G., Anne J., Climate change adaptation and gender inequality: insights from rural vietnam, Subtainability, 11, pp. 2-16, (2019); Tran A.K., Mai M.M., Tan N., Van Dung N., Nguyen H.N., Smart agriculture using IoT multi-sensors: a novel watering management system, JSAN, 8, 45, pp. 2-22, (2019); Laura G., Lorena P., Jose M.J., Et al., Iot-based smart irrigation systems: an overview on the recent trends on sensors and iot systems for irrigation in precision agriculture, Sensors, 20, 1042, pp. 2-48, (2019); Uferah S., Rafia M., Jose G.-N., Syed Ali H., Syed Ali R.Z., Naveed I., Precision agriculture techniques and practices: from considerations to applications, Sensors, 19, 3796, pp. 2-25, (2019); Hatano Y., Kanda Y., Udo K., Et al., A wind tunnel experiment of s and transport and its comparison with the werner mode, J Geophys Res, 109, F01001, pp. 1-10, (2004); Tomasz A.L., A review of field methods to survey coastal dunes–experience based on research from south baltic coast, J Coastal Conserv, 20, pp. 175-190, (2016); Ghadiry M., Shalaby A., Koch B., A new gis-based model for automated extraction of sand dune encroachment case study: Dakhla oases, western desert of egypt, Egyptian J Remote Sens Space Sci, 15, pp. 53-65, (2012); Manik D.A., Sabyasachi M., Susanta P., Adarsa J., Soumya K.M., Arnab S., Gis based beach sand budget analysis through seasonal beach profiling using cartographic techniques, Model Earth Syst Env, 2, 74, pp. 2-13, (2016); Kim H., Zohaib M., Cho E., Kerr Y.H., Choi M.H., Development and assessment of the sand dust prediction model by utilizing microwave-based satellite soil moisture and reanalysis datasets in east asian desert areas, Adv Meteorol, 2017, pp. 2-13, (2017); Brownett J.M., Mills R.S., The development and application of remote sensing to monitor sand dune habitats, J Coast Conserv, 21, pp. 643-656, (2017); ElSayed H., Sebastien L., Islam A.E.M., Retrieving sand dune movements using sub-pixel correlation of multi-temporal optical remote sensing imagery, northwest sinai peninsula, egypt, Remote Sens Env, 121, pp. 51-60, (2012); Diego S., Julia S., Carlos C., Jose L.C., Pablo G., Detecting areas vulnerable to sand encroachment using remote sensing and gis techniques in nouakchott, mauritania, Remote Sens, 10, 1541, pp. 2-18, (2018); Pozzebon A., Andreadis A., Bertoni D., Bove C., A wireless sensor network framework for real-time monitoring of height and volume variations on sandy beaches and dunes, ISPRS, 7, 141, pp. 2-18, (2018); Pozzebon A., Cappelli I., Mecocci A., Bertoni D., Sarti G., Alquini F., A wireless sensor network for the real-time remote measurement of aeolian sand transport on sandy beaches and dunes, J Comput Phys, 18, 820, pp. 2-21, (2018); Saymohammadi S., Zarafshani K., Tavakoli M., Mahdizadeh H., Amiri F., A prediction of climate change induced temperature & precipitation: The case of iran, Sustainability, 9, 146, pp. 2-13, (2017); Kim M.J., Hall C.M., Can climate change awareness predict pro-environmental practices in restaurants?

To address this, a prioritisation exercise was undertaken to identify priority research questions concerning digital agriculture in the UK, but with a view to also informing international contexts. The prioritisation exercise uses an established and effective participatory methodology for capturing and ordering a wide range of views. The method involves identifying a large number of participants and eliciting an initial long list of research questions which is reduced and refined in subsequent voting stages to select the top priorities by theme. Participants were selected using purposive sampling and snowballing to represent a number of sectors, organisations, companies and disciplines across the UK. They were each invited to submit up to 10 questions according to certain criteria, and this resulted in 195 questions from a range of 40 participants (largely from England with some representation from Scotland and Wales). Preliminary analysis and clustering of these questions through iterative analysis identified seven themes as follows: data governance; data management; enabling use of data and technologies; understanding benefits and uptake of data and technologies; optimising data and technologies for performance; impacts of digital agriculture; and new collaborative arrangements. Subsequent stages of voting, using an online ranking exercise and a participant workshop for in-depth discussion, refined the questions to a total of 27 priority research questions categorised into 15 gold, 7 silver and 5 bronze, across the 7 themes. The questions significantly enrich and extend previous clustering and agenda setting using literature sources, and provide a range of new perspectives. The analysis highlights the interconnectedness of themes and questions, and proposes two nexus for future research: the different dimensions of value, and the social and institutional arrangements to support digitalisation in agriculture. These emphasise the importance of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, and the need to tackle the binary nature of current analytical frames. These new insights are equally relevant to contexts outside the UK. This paper highlights the need for research actions to inform policy, not only instrumentally by strengthening the evidence base, but also conceptually, to prompt new thinking. To our knowledge this methodology has not been previously applied to this topic. © 2022","Digital agriculture; Digitalisation; Research priorities; Smart farming; Stakeholders; UK","United Kingdom; digitization; farming system; research; stakeholder","","","","","UK Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government, Defra","The authors wish to thank the UK Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) for funding this research.

At the same time, modern society starts looking at food not just as edibles, a necessary thing in order to survive but as enhanced nutriments that can have many health benefits. Moreover, some components of agriculture products can be extracted and used as supplements or to enrich cosmetics. In order to maximize the desired effects, it is important to study the environmental conditions that affect the production of such components, and the best period to collect the products.

This paper provides practical examples of supply chain digitalization, as well as its socio-economic and environmental effects. The absence of processes that are compatible with the high production requirements adopted in foreign markets can lead to crisis phenomena in domestic industries with high potential and rapid growth dynamics in agriculture industry. Agriculture in Russia is an integral part of the agro-industrial complex, and the program ""Digitalization of its supply chain"" should provide participants with the opportunity to use broadband, mobile, LPWAN communications, information technologies (small and big data, management platforms, etc.) of the domestic instrument industry (tags, controllers, sensors, control units) to improve significantly the efficiency of agriculture. The opportunities for modernizing the industry are huge. Food security of the country and the development of export potential, turn agriculture into a high-tech industry that can not only provide food for itself, but also many countries of the world through the global supply chain system, as well as create opportunities for the introduction of new innovative developments that have not exist before, stimulate management decisions that can provide the population with high-quality and safe products. According to expert estimates, during the season, the farmer has to make more than 40 different decisions in limited time intervals. Many of these solutions, which affect directly the production economy, are objects of digitalization in supply chain. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Control of production technology; Cost reduction; Digital technologies; Digital transformations; E-commerce; Supply chain management","","","","","","","","On national goals and strategic objectives for the development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2024, (2018); On creating a system of state information support for agriculture, (2008); Hung T.T., Preventing human trafficking in Vietnam through economic empowerment programmers, International journal of criminology and sociology, 9, pp. 1-8, (2020); Ministry of Agriculture and Higher School of Economics, Forecast of scientific and technological development of the agro-industrial complex of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2030; Results of the National Agricultural Census of 2016: In 8 volumes/ Federal State Statistics Service, (2018); Ashmarov I.A., Some approaches to the study of the USSR' military economy in the soviet and russian national historiography, Historical Bulletin, 1, 2, pp. 19-31, (2018); Minakova I.V., Social and economic condition of Russia and possibility of its transition to innovative hi-tech model, Modern Economy Success, 6, pp. 24-27, (2017); Gnatyuk S.N., Pekert N.A., Education as a factor of sustainable development of agriculture, Russian Economic Bulletin, 1, 3, pp. 18-27, (2018); Olkhovskiy V.V., Assessment of the impact of macroeconomic and demographic factors on the Russian model of employment, Modern Economy Success, 2, pp. 31-37, (2018); Narkevich L.V., Narkevich E.A., Financial condition analysis in the crisis management system, Russian Economic Bulletin, 1, 4, pp. 10-24, (2018); Novikov S.V., Government stimulation and regulation of Russian innovation producers export expansion, Modern Economy Success, 3, pp. 24-27, (2017); Schwarzkopf N.V., Improving the use of data mining technology as a way of reducing credit risk, Russian Economic Bulletin, 1, 1, pp. 10-18, (2018); Moiseenko Z.N., State support of small forms of management in agro-industrial complex: State and development trends, Modern Economy Success, 4, pp. 12-17, (2017); Bogatov H.L., Abazova M.V., Yaitskaya E.A., State regulation of employment and reduction of rural poverty in the North Caucasus Federal District, Modern Economy Success, 6, pp. 88-92, (2017); Shcherbinina A.G., Macroeconomic perspective forecasts for business, Success of Modern Science and Education, 11-12, pp. 102-108, (2017); Moiseenko Z.N., State support of small forms of management in agro-industrial complex: State and development trends, Modern Economy Success, 4, pp. 12-17, (2017); Komarova S.L., The assessment of the consumer basket for the analysis of the region competitiveness, Russian Economic Bulletin, 1, 2, pp. 19-25, (2018); Kobets E.A., The implementation of import substitution programme in the agricultural sector, Modern Scientist, 2, pp. 71-74, (2017); Kupryushin P.A., Chernyatina G.N., Economic and environmental aspects of rational nature management and optimization of the process of import substitution in the agro-industrial complex, Modern Economy Success, 3, pp. 44-48, (2017); Narkevich L.V., Analysis of industrial capacity and break-even production in the crisis management system, Russian Economic Bulletin, 1, 3, pp. 28-41, (2018); Vernigor N.F., The system of state support of agricultural production (case study-the example of the Altai territory), Modern Economy Success, 6, pp. 7-10, (2017)","","","ExcelingTech","","","","","","20513771","","","","English","Int.

Moreover, the abuse of pesticides and fertilizers is a fundamental cause of soil and water pollution. Finding sustainable countermeasures for these problems requires completely new approaches and the integration of knowledge. Precision agriculture (PA) is a technology that reduces environmental pollution with minimal input (e.g., fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides) and maximize the production of high-quality crops by monitoring the conditions and environment of farmland and crops. However, the lack of data—a key technology for realizing PA—remains a major obstacle to the large-scale adoption of PA. Herein, we discuss important research issues, such as data managements and analysis for accurate decision-making, and specific data acquisition strategies. Moreover, we systematically review and discuss electrochemical sensors, including sensors that monitor the plant, soil, and environmental conditions that directly affect plant growth.

Leaf area is viewed as a significant marker in the investigation and evaluation of the development and assessment of the production potential of a crop. Leaf area index is an important factor for calculating the amount of energy used in the photosynthesis process, evapotranspiration, crop growth monitoring, nutrition requirement, and change in crop water requirement. Leaf area index is directly related to yield prediction. It also helps to estimate the percentage of crop growth affected by pests and diseases. Leaf area index is calculated using destructive sampling method are removing several plants from the field and placing the plant in leaf area index calculating machine. This type of sampling method is an expensive and time taking process. The camera sensor captures the crop image and transmits it to the base station to estimate the leaf area index through identifying potentially constitute the number of pixels in the leaf. These green pixels are used to calculate the leaf area in the image. The important features of this cost-efficient method are its suitability for precise, user-friendly, and non-destructive crop sample methods. This method can estimate the leaf area index for a crop without any expensive tools. The convolutional neural network is used for calculating leaf area index. Wireless sensor networks place an important role in data management and future data analysis. Crop growth monitoring is a reliable process because wireless sensor networks provide frequent data collecting without human interaction.  © 2021 IEEE.","CNN; Crop growth monitoring; Image processing; IoT; Leaf area index; Wireless sensor network","Crops; Information management; Internet of things; Pixels; CNN; Crop growth; Crop growth monitoring; Energy; Growth monitoring; Human civilization; Images processing; Leaf area; Leaf Area Index; Sampling method; Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","Pearcy R.W., Et al., Plant Physiological Ecology; Easlon H.M., Bloom A.J., Easy leaf area: Automated digital image analysis for rapid and accurate measurement of leaf area, Applications in Plant Sciences, 2, 7, (2014); Ji-Hua M., Bing-Fang W., Qiangzi L., A global crop growth monitoring system based on remote sensing, The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 37, (2008); Glozer K., Protocol for Leaf Image Analysis-Surface Area; Pandey S.K., Singh H., A simple, cost-effectivemethod for leaf area estimation, Journal of Botany, 2011; Aboukarima A.M., Zayed M.F., Minyawi M., Elsoury H.A., Tarabye H.H.H., Image analysisbased system for estimating cotton leaf area, Aboukarima et Al.; ARJA, 5, 1, pp. 1-8, (2017); Fang H., Liang S., Leaf Area Index Models; Vijayakumar T., Posed inverse problem rectification using novel deep convolutional neural network, Journal of Innovative Image Processing (JIIP), 2, 3, pp. 121-127, (2020); Chen J.I.Z., Hengjinda P., Early Prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD) by machine learning method-A comparative study, Journal of Artificial Intelligence, 3, 1, pp. 17-33, (2021); Blanco F.F., Folegatti M.V., Estimation of leaf area for greenhouse cucumber by linear measurements under salinity and grafting, Agricultural Science, 62, 4, pp. 305-309, (2005); Sestak Z., Catsky J., Jarvis P.G., Plant Photosynthesis Production, Mannual of Methods, (1971); Tieszen L.L., Biomass accumulation and primary production, Techniques in Bio-Productivity & Photosynthesis, pp. 16-19, (1982); Bleasdale J.K.A., Plant Physiology in Relation to Horticulture, (1984); Harper J.L., Population Biology of Plants, (1977)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications, ICIRCA 2021","2 September 2021 through 4 September 2021","Coimbatore","172137","","978-073814627-0","","","English","Proc.

A CPS is a complex system that includes hardware and software components, with different suppliers and connection protocols, forcing complex data management and storage. For this reason, the construction, verification and diagnosis of security CPS become a major challenge, which involves a correct specification of security requirements, the verification of the correct system configurations, and if necessary, the diagnosis to detect the features to be modified to obtain a security configuration. In this paper, we propose a framework for the verification and diagnosis of security requirements, according to the possible correct configurations of the CPS. The framework is based on the specification of the security requirements and their analysis supported by Model-Driven Engineering and Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) approaches. To illustrate the usefulness, the proposal has been applied to the security requirements in an Agriculture 4.0 scenario based on automated hydroponic cultivation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Configuration models; Cyber-physical system; Cybersecurity; Diagnosis; Security; Security requirements; Security verification","Agricultural robots; Cryptography; Cultivation; Cyber Physical System; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Software design; Specifications; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Hardware and software components; Hydroponic cultivation; Industrial environments; Model-driven Engineering; Security configurations; Software Product Line Engineering(SPLE); System configurations; Information management","","","","","AETHER-US, (PID2020-112540RB-C44/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); COPERNICA; Consejería de Transformación Económica, Industria, Conocimiento y Universidades, Junta de Andalucía, (P20_01224); Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes; GENESIS; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-112540RB-C42); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (SBPLY/17/180501/000202); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM","This work has been funded by the projects AETHER-UCLM ( Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación , PID2020-112540RB-C42), AETHER-US (PID2020-112540RB-C44/AEI/10.13039/501100011033), COPERNICA ( Consejería de Transformación Económica, Industria, Conocimiento y Universidades, Junta de Andalucía , P20_01224), and GENESIS ( Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes, Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha, Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional FEDER , SBPLY/17/180501/000202).","Abendroth N.P., Kleiner B.A., Cybersecurity Policy for the Internet of Things, (2017); Arciniegas J.L., Due nas J.C., Ruiz J.L., Ceron R., Bermejo J., Oltra M.A., Architecture reasoning for supporting product line evolution: an example on security, Software Product Lines, pp. 327-372, (2006); Arrieta A., Sagardui G., Etxeberria L., Cyber-Physical Systems Product Lines: Variability Analysis and Challenges, (2015); Arrieta A., Wang S., Sagardui G., Etxeberria L., Search-based test case selection of cyber-physical system product lines for simulation-based validation, 20th International Systems and Software Product Line Conference, SPLC 2016, Beijing, China, September 16–23, pp. 297-306, (2016); Ashibani Y., Mahmoud Q.H., Cyber physical systems security: analysis, challenges and solutions, Comput.

This data must be processed very quickly, especially for the systems that need to make real-time decisions. The Kappa architecture provides a way to process Agriculture 4.0 data at high speed in the cloud, and thus meets processing requirements. This paper presents an optimized version of the Kappa architecture allowing fast and efficient data management in Agriculture. The goal of this optimized version of the classical Kappa architecture is to improve memory management and processing speed. the Kappa architecture parameters are fine tuned in order to process data from a concrete use cases. The results of this work have shown the impact of parameters tweaking on the speed of treatment. We have also proven that the combination of Apache Samza with Apache Druid offers the better performances. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

The CEBA should fill the gap of a regional institutional platform to share, search, store and visualize heterogeneous scientific data related to the environment and agricultural researches. One of the main features of this tool is its ease of use and the accessibility of all types of data. To answer the question of data description, a scientific consensus has been established around the qualification of data with at least the information “when” (time), “where” (geographical coordinates) and “what” (metadata). The development of an on-premise solution using the data lake concept to provide a cloud service for end-users with institutional authentication and for open data access has been completed. Compared to other platforms, CEBA fully supports the management of geographic coordinates at every stage of data management. A comprehensive JavaScript Objet Notation (JSON) architecture has been designed, among other things, to facilitate multi-stage data enrichment. Data from the wireless network are queried and accessed in near real-time, using a distributed JSON-based search engine. © 2022 by the authors.

Currently, most growers randomly install a limited number of sensors due to economic implications and data management issues. The microclimate within a protected cultivation system is continuously affected by the macroclimate (ambient), which further complicates decision-making around optimal sensor placement. The ambient weather's effect on the indoor microclimate makes it challenging to predict or acquire the ideal condition of the systems through using sensors. This study proposed and implemented a machine learning (K-Means++) algorithm to select optimal sensor locations through clustering. Temperature and relative humidity data were collected from 56 different locations within the greenhouse for over a year covering and these covered four major seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). The data was processed to remove outliers or noise interference using interquartile. The original temperature and relative humidity data were transformed to other air properties (dew point temperature, enthalpy, humid ratio, and specific volume) and used in simulations. The results obtained showed that the number of optimal sensor locations ranged between 3 and 5, and there were similar sensor locations among the air properties. An online machine learning web-based system was developed to systematically determine the optimal number of sensors and location. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Air properties; Artificial intelligence; Greenhouse; Kmeans ++; Temperature and relative humidity","Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Greenhouses; Humidity control; Information management; K-means clustering; Location; Machine learning; Air properties; Controlled environment agricultures; Decisions makings; K-means; Kmean ++; Machine-learning; Online machines; Optimal sensor locations; Sensor clustering; Temperature and relative humidity; agriculture; algorithm; artificial intelligence; cluster analysis; data management; decision making; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; machine learning; relative humidity; sensor; temperature effect; Decision making","","","","","Data Application Technology for Postharvest Management of Agricultural & Livestock Products Project, (PJ016981); Republic of Korea; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA; Rural Development Administration, RDA; Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, iPET, (320001-4, 322038031SB010, 716001-7); Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, iPET","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, and Forestry (IPET) through Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Convergence Technologies Program for Educating Creative Global Leaders (320001-4) and (716001-7), and Open Field Smart Agriculture Technology Short-term Advancement Program (322038031SB010) and the Rural Development Administration (RDA) through the Development of Data Application Technology for Postharvest Management of Agricultural & Livestock Products Project (PJ016981) funded by Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), Republic of Korea ","Ahonen T., Virrankoski R., Elmusrati M., (2008); Arnesano M., Revel G., Seri F., A tool for the optimal sensor placement to optimize temperature monitoring in large sports spaces, Autom.

Despite the increasing contribution of technologies such as transgenic cultivars, machines, inputs and more efficient data management, in recent years there has been a stagnation of cotton productivity in the State of Mato Grosso (MT). Data Mining (MD) techniques offer an excellent opportunity to assess this problem. Through the rules-based classification applied to a real database (BD) of cotton production in MT, factors were identified that were affecting and consequently limiting the increase in productivity. In the pre-processing of the data, we perform the attributes, selection, transformation and identification of outliers. Numerical attributes were discretized using automatic techniques: Kononenko (KO), Better Encoding (BE) and combination: KO + BE. In modeling the rule algorithms used were PART [1] and JRip, both implemented in the WEKA tool. Performance was assessed using statistical metrics: accuracy, recall, cost and their combination using the IFC index (created by the authors). Results showed better performance for the PART classifier, with discretization by the KO + BE technique, followed by binary conversion. The analysis of the rules made it possible to identify the attributes that most impact productivity.

LTD, Kunming, China","Cyanobacteria are a large class of single-cell prokaryotes capable of oxygen-producing photosynthesis. When cyanobacteria are stimulated by nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements, it will cause eutrophication of the water body and cause the phenomenon of 'bloom' in the lake, which seriously endangers the safety of humans, livestock, fish and shrimp. The monitoring and management of cyanobacteria blooms have been plagued by lake management units. At present, the product functions related to the prevention and control of cyanobacteria blooms are very single. The product functions are roughly divided into two categories, some of which focus only on the monitoring link and the other only focus on the salvage and processing link. There is no one product that can combine the two links well. In view of this situation, this article has designed and developed a set of cyanobacteria and algae prevention and control disposal management system, which effectively combines the monitoring and salvage links. The system includes four subsystems: operation report subsystem, monitoring data management system, algae mud environmental protection whole process management system and real-time cyanobacteria monitoring system.

It will additionally focus on the transfer of technology and knowledge to farmers and the communication of modern, sustainable agriculture practices and biomass production to consumers. InnoHof will extend, diversify, and digitize an existing agricultural farm in Groß Kreutz, Germany, and be managed by the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy (ATB) in cooperation with numerous industrial and research partners. In order to enable modern research methods and measurement techniques for the numerous studies that will be carried out by the InnoHof scientists and farmers, a comprehensive Internet of Things (IoT) system will be developed, including • widely-distributed sensor networks for automated and manually-controlled, mobile and stationary equipment for status detection (soil, plant, insect, animal, environmental conditions, biodiversity, and so on), • still, spectral, and video systems using fixed and equipment-mounted (including drone) cameras, • realtime monitoring of barn climate and animal welfare, • specific farm equipment and implements for precision agriculture and on-farm field experiments, • robotics and Global Navigation Satellite System technology for automation of new plant production techniques, • communication and IT infrastructure for field monitoring stations as well as highbandwidth and reliable site connectivity, • highly extensible computing and storage resources on site to securely store and process petabyte-scale data, • modern virtualisation solutions to react flexibly and effectively to changing and rapidly growing requirements in storage and computing, • traditional and AI-based methods for data analysis, • implementation of digital twins based on sensor inputs to monitor, simulate, and control sundry farming, processing, and renewable energy systems, and • a comprehensive data management system to handle manual and automated ingestion of data, control access rights for proprietary data, ensure FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles, and simplify steps needed to publish datasets in order to enhance use and reuse of data and maximize scientific output. The InnoHof farm has a land area of approximately 950 ha, with scattered fields located at distances up to about 10 km from the main research station in Groß Kreutz, presenting challenges for designing and implementing an IT infrastructure plan for a continuous, realtime sensor network. A feasibility study to determine the necessary usage requirements is currently underway. As InnoHof is planned to be a flexible research infrastructure, providing facilities for new research projects and open to new collaboration partners in the future, the InnoHof IoT infrastructure will be designed to be scalable, accepting changing sensor configurations and ever-increasing requirements for data storage and processing. We present here a status report on the IoT platform design and implementation. © 2022, VDI Verlag GMBH.

This is particularly relevant in water-scarce regions where there are plans to increase the land under irrigation to enhance food security, yet the actual spatial extent of current irrigation areas is unknown. This study applied a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, the random forest, to process and classify irrigated areas using images acquired by the Landsat and Sentinel satellites, for Mpumalanga Province in Africa. The classification process was automated on a big-data management platform, the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the R-programming was used for post-processing. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was subsequently used to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed areas during 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter growing seasons. High NDVI values on cultivated land during the dry season are an indication of irrigation. The classification of cultivated areas was for 2020, but 2019 irrigated areas were also classified to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on agriculture. The comparison in irrigated areas between 2019 and 2020 facilitated an assessment of changes in irrigated areas in smallholder farming areas. The approach enhanced the classification accuracy of irrigated areas using ground-based training samples and very high-resolution images (VHRI) and fusion with existing datasets and the use of expert and local knowledge of the study area. The overall classification accuracy was 88%. © 2021 by the authors.","Change detection; Image classification; Spatial analysis; Vegetation indices; Water management","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision trees; Engines; Food supply; Image enhancement; Information management; Irrigation; Land use; Machine learning; Random forests; Water management; Agricultural water management; Classification accuracy; Classification process; Irrigation expansions; Land Use Planning; Normalised difference vegetation index; Random forest classifier; Very high resolution (VHR) image; Classification (of information)","","","","","Wellcome Trust, WT, (205200/Z/16/Z); Water Research Commission, WRC; Tshwane University of Technology, TUT","The Tshwane University of Technology funded this research and the APC.

Various FMISs have been developed to support the management of farm businesses. A key artefact in the development of FMISs is the software architecture that defines the gross level structure of the system. The software architecture is important for understanding the system, analysing the design decisions and guiding the further development of the system based on the architecture. To assist in the design of the FMIS architecture, several reference architectures have been provided in the literature. Unfortunately, in practice, it is less trivial to derive the application architecture from these reference architectures. Two underlying reasons for this were identified. First of all, it appears that the proposed reference architectures do not specifically focus on FMIS but have a rather broad scope of the agricultural domain in general. Secondly, the proposed reference architectures do not seem to have followed the proper architecture documentation guidelines as defined in the software architecture community, lack precision, and thus impeding the design of the required application architectures. Presented in this article is a novel reference architecture that is dedicated to the specific FMIS domain, and which is documented using the software architecture documentation guidelines.

The identification of such variables is a complex but solvable task, since the amount of recorded data among livestock is nowadays huge and manageable through Machine Learning techniques. Besides, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the type of management allows the breeder to consolidate the ongoing processes or, on the contrary, to adopt new management strategies. To solve this problem, we propose a Genetic Programming approach, a white-box technique suitable for big data management, and with an intrinsic ability to select important variables, providing simple models. The most frequent variables encapsulated in the models built by Genetic Programming are highlighted, and their zoological significance is investigated a posteriori, evaluating the performance of the prediction models. Moreover, two of the final expressions selected only three variables among the 48 given in input, one of which is the best performing among GP models. The expressions were then analyzed in order to propose a zootechnical interpretation of the equations. Comparisons with other common techniques, including also black-box methods, are performed, in order to evaluate the performance of different type of methods in terms of accuracy and generalization ability. The approach entailed constructive and helpful considerations to the addressed task, confirming its key-role in the zootechnical field, especially in the beef breeding management. © 2020","Cattle breeding; Evolutionary algorithms; Machine learning; Piemontese bovines; Precision livestock farming","article; beef cattle; big data; cattle farming; evolutionary algorithm; genetic model; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; prediction","","","","","AICE, (DSAIPA/DS/0113/2019); PREDICT, (PTDC/CCI-CIF/29,877/2017); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (DSAIPA/DS/0022/2018, PTDC/CCI-INF/29,168/2017, UIDB/00,408/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was partially supported by FCT through funding of LASIGE Research Unit (UIDB/00,408/2020) and projects BINDER (PTDC/CCI-INF/29,168/2017), GADgET (DSAIPA/DS/0022/2018), AICE (DSAIPA/DS/0113/2019) and PREDICT (PTDC/CCI-CIF/29,877/2017).

Information systems programmers have long been building their programs on data files and files have played an important role in storing information. In the data file processing system, each program is designed to perform a specific purpose and has its own files without a general framework linking all the programs and possibly repeated data in more than one file. The use of these files many problems and disadvantages such as data redundancy, heterogeneity or data compatibility, limited participation, and the difficulty of maintenance.

An early recognition of critical events in a herd can lead to an improved animal welfare and thus for example in a reduced need of antibiotics. Furthermore, it has been found that even feeding intake and efficiency can be affected by animal behaviour. Due to the size of modern livestock farming operations, the usage of automated systems becomes necessary. We present a scalable automated monitoring system composed of low-cost IP video surveillance cameras and affordable edge-computing hardware on-site, complemented by standardized web services that allow for long term video storage and analysis. For the automated analysis of eating- and resting time as well as activity levels in videos, we perform state-of-the-art object detection and tracking using a YOLOv3 DeepSORT Convolutional Neural Network. Data management and the integration of the analysis system into the farmers’ work-flows are achieved using a distributed service interoperability network that allows the exchange of data between different services related to livestock management. The interoperability network is completely federated and based on established web technologies. Interoperability is achieved through standardized APIs and data formats. This enables farmers for example to seamlessly integrate behaviour analysis results into feeding management systems, or to share the results with external consultancy services or other stakeholders in the production chain. Furthermore, the standardized data exchange removes the extra workload that is caused by entering the same data into different systems. © ECPLF 2022.

Current advances in data management are making Smart Farming grow exponentially as data have become the key element in modern agriculture to help producers with critical decision-making. Valuable advantages appear with objective information acquired through sensors with the aim of maximizing productivity and sustainability. This kind of data-based managed farms rely on data that can increase efficiency by avoiding the misuse of resources and the pollution of the environment. Data-driven agriculture, with the help of robotic solutions incorporating artificial intelligent techniques, sets the grounds for the sustainable agriculture of the future. This paper reviews the current status of advanced farm management systems by revisiting each crucial step, from data acquisition in crop fields to variable rate applications, so that growers can make optimized decisions to save money while protecting the environment and transforming how food will be produced to sustainably match the forthcoming population growth. © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture 4.0; AI; Big data; Farm management information system (FMIS); IoT; Robotics; Variable-rate technology (VRT)","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (737669)","Funding: This research article is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement Nº737669.

The data are used through different devices, and different processing techniques are applied on it to derive meaningful results with effective decision-making. The data can be cut short, tailored or manipulated in several ways to mould the same which can give visible interpretations to the people. At the same time, complex problems can also be solved. Further, through the data cleaning and the integration processes, a large cluster of data can be made simple and easy to use for calculations. Big data pre-processing approaches are applied to improve the visibility of big data to DSS to get a more effective analytics view in order to get useful insight. The requirements of compatible data management have considerably increased in the field of agriculture in India over the years. In the backdrop of these requirements, the present paper provides a framework for the detection of duplicate data using certain measures that are trainable and manageable. Moreover, the framework has been examined a number of times based on the Precision, Recall, and F measure techniques in this paper.  © 2021 IEEE.","Agriculture; Big data; Data mining; Duplicate data; Duplicate Selection; Precision; Recall","Agriculture; Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Decision making; Information management; Complex problems; Decision-making process; Decisions makings; Digital technologies; Duplicate data; Duplicate selection; Precision; Processing technique; Recall; Time complexes; Big data","","","","","","","Yong N.U., Mooney R.J., Using information extraction to aid the discovery of prediction rules from text, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2000) Workshop on Text Mining, pp. 51-58, (2000); Monge A.E., Elkan C., The Field matching problem: Algorithms and applications, Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 267-270, (1996); Newcomb H.B., Kennedy J.M., Axford S.J., James A.P., Automatic linkage of vital records, Science, pp. 954-959, (1956); McCallum A.K., Nigam K., Ungar L., Efficient clustering of high-dimensional data sets with application to reference matching, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2000), pp. 169-178, (2000); Cohen W.W., Kautz H., McAlester D., Hardening soft information sources, Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 255-259, (2000); Mayer-Schonberger V., Cukier K., Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think, pp. 1143-1144, (2014); Julien J., Preda C., Functional data clustering: A survey, Advances in Data Analysis and Classification, 8, 3, pp. 231-255, (2014); Dweepna G., Gohil P., Trivedi K., Modified Fuzzy K-mean clustering using MapReduce in Hadoop and cloud, Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT), IEEE International Conference on, pp. 1-5, (2015); Furnas G.W., Deerwester S., Dumais S.T., Landauer T.K., Harshman R.A., Streeter L.A., Lochbaum K.E., Information retrieval using a singular value decomposition model of latent semantic structure, Proceedings of the 11th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 465-480, (1988); Nisarg D., Mistry H., Verma J.P., Text data analysis: Computer aided automated assessment system, Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2017 3rd International Conference on, pp. 1-4, (2017); Wardlow B.D., Callahan K., A multi-scale accuracy assessment of the MODIS irrigated agriculture data-set (MIrAD) for the state of Nebraska USA, GIScience& Remote Sensing, 51, pp. 575-592, (2014); Wang K., Yu P.S., Chakraborty S., Bottom-up generalization: A data mining solution to privacy protection, Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining; Min C., Mao S., Liu Y., Big data: A survey, Mobile Networks and Applications, pp. 171-209, (2014); Xindong W., Zhu X., Wu G., Ding W., Data mining with big data, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, pp. 97-107, (2014); Ricardo B., Ribeiro-Neto B., Modern Information Retrieval, 463, (1999); Najim D., Et al., Cosine similarity scoring without score normalization techniques, Odyssey, (2010); Shiyong W., Wan J., Zhang D., Li D., Zhang C., Towards smart factory for industry 4.0: A self-organized multi-agent system with big data based feedback and coordination, Computer Networks, pp. 158-168, (2016); Hernandez M.A., Stolfo S.J., The merge/purge problem for large databases, Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD-95), pp. 127-138, (1995); Dweepna G., Trivedi K., Fuzzy k-mean clustering in mapreduce on cloud based hadoop, Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT), 2014 International Conference on, pp. 1607-1610, (2014); Thombare, Big data analytics for climate-smart agriculture, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, 7, 4, (2017); Newcombe H.B., Kennedy J.M., Axford S.J., James A.P., Automatic linkage of vital records, Science, 130, pp. 954-959, (1959); PhridviRaj M.S.B., GuruRao C.V., Data mining-past, present and future-a typical survey on data streams, Procedia Technology, 12, pp. 255-263, (2014); McCallum A.K., Nigam K., Ungar L., Efficient clustering of high-dimensional data sets with application to reference matching, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2000), pp. 169-178, (2000)","","Kumar R.; Jain S.; Sohal H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control, ISPCC 2021","7 October 2021 through 9 October 2021","Solan","174517","26438615","978-166542552-0","","","English","Proc.

The 1970s FAO-UNESCO volume VI was the first ever official map of African soils with the scale of 1:5 M. This chapter focused on the glimpse of advancements and collective achievements of soil research in Africa and highlighted existing challenges and opportunities to suggest their implications on the future of soil research advancement in the continent. A systematic literature survey of the web of science core collection, expert knowledge and compilation of Africa centric soil research were conducted, and development reports and books on achievements, challenges, and opportunities published by different national, regional, and international institutions including the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGAIR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) were reviewed. Results showed that most of the past 100 years soil research in Africa were supported and promoted by funding from international and multinational donor organization. However, several soil researches done by local universities and research institutions were not accessible through the global database, which has been one of the biggest challenges for knowledge sharing. Key biophysical and systemic challenges in African soil research included: land degradation, soil nutrient imbalances, research priority mismatch, and helicopter researching. The availability of 30 m resolution continental digital soil map is marked as a key achievement to design sustainable soil heath interventions in the future. Finally, six key issues are put forward, as a well thought out option to advance soil research in Africa in the remainder of the twenty-first century, these are: (1) revising and integrating soil research in academia, (2) establishing a robust knowledge and data management system, (3) standardization of methods, (4) increasing crop response research data, (5) validating predictive soil map outputs, and (6) calling for continental alliance for soil interventions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Africa; Soil; Twenty-first century","","","","","","","","Agegnehu G., Amede T., Integrated soil fertility and plant nutrient management in tropical agro-ecosystems: A review, Pedosphere, 27, pp. 662-680, (2017); 2013-14 Annual Report.

To date, the information management method for China's agricultural supply chain is usually stored in a centralized database and file system, with weak information management capabilities, leading to problems such as theft, tampering, deletion, and inconsistencies. In light of these problems, we introduce blockchain technology which is a cutting-edge technology in digital finance and has developed rapidly. This paper proposes a data management system based on blockchain technology and affords efficient data extraction, management and access control for heterogeneous forms of data across the agricultural supply chain. The data management system includes four credible data management platforms: agricultural production information, recording transportation information, farmer-consumer transaction information, and consumer credit information. It also can add more platforms according to later needs and combine an interstellar distributed file system and smart contract technology, making it possible to conduct information security research throughout the agricultural supply chain. The proposed system effectively protects information about supply chain activities including agricultural product production, warehousing, transportation, distribution, and sales. It implements seamless connection between agricultural product production and marketing, enabling the transforming and upgrading of agriculture, thereby helping farmers increase their income and eliminate poverty. © 2020 IEEE.","Agricultural supply chain; Blockchain; Data access; Data extraction; Data management; Smart contract","Access control; Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Blockchain; Data mining; File organization; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Agricultural productions; Agricultural supply chains; Centralized data-base; Cutting edge technology; Data management system; Distributed file systems; Management capabilities; Transaction information; Information management","","","","","","","Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system [J], Consulted, pp. 1-9, (2008); Muzammal M., Qu Q., Nasrulin B., Renovating blockchain with distributed databases: An open source system [J], Future Generation Computer Systems, 90, pp. 105-117, (2019); Chandrahaas V.S., Sankar V.R., Blockchain: A distributed ledger technology [J], Csi CommunICatIonS, 17, (2012); Franco P., Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics [M], (2014); Cheng J.C., Lee N.Y., Chi C., Et al., Blockchain and smart contract for digital certificate [C], 2018 Ieee International Conference on Applied System Invention (ICASI), pp. 1046-1051, (2018); Tschorsch F., Scheuermann B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies [J], Ieee Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 18, 3, pp. 2084-2123, (2016); Zheng Z., Xie S., Dai H.N., Et al., Blockchain challenges and opportunities: A survey [J], International Journal of Web and Grid Services, 14, 4, pp. 352-375, (2018); Qu Q., Nurgaliev I., Muzammal M., Et al., On spatio-temporal blockchain query processing [J], Future Generation Computer Systems, 98, pp. 208-218, (2019); Li X., Jiang P., Chen T., Et al., A survey on the security of blockchain systems [J], Future Generation Computer Systems, (2017); Nasrulin B., Muzammal M., Qu Q., Chainmob: Mobility analytics on blockchain [C], 2018 19th Ieee International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM), pp. 292-293, (2018); Lemieux V.L., Trusting records: Is blockchain technology the answer?

Agricultural informatization construction is a major measure to strengthen the basic position of agriculture and promote the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution. It is of great significance to develop agricultural economy and promote the construction of a new socialist countryside. With the rise and continuous improvement of cloud computing, it has brought new inspiration to the construction of agricultural informatization. Cloud computing is the latest network information technology at present. It creates a new model of serving computing resources, storage resources and information resources under the condition of rapid network development, so that information can spread at a high speed, so that farmers can get better agricultural technology and more agricultural information resources in the shortest time, so as to greatly improve the agricultural economy. In recent years, the new cloud computing technology provides a new method and feeling for the construction of agricultural economic management information service platform. In order to realize the rapid acquisition of a variety of information resources and the sharing of information data, and improve the service level and service quality of agricultural information, taking the new IT resource model 'cloud computing' as the starting point, computing and big data are distributed on computers all over the country. People can easily obtain applications, data and resources through mobile phones, computers and other services. Relying on cloud computing technology, the agricultural economic management information service platform can not only give full play to the township Internet and call rate with high coverage in China, but also realize unlimited capacity storage, fast and high-speed operation and fast and efficient information transmission that cannot be realized by traditional technology without pressure. So as to realize the convenient access and comprehensive sharing of a variety of information resources, and improve the level and quality of agricultural information services.  © 2022 IEEE.","Agricultural economic data; Agricultural informatization; Cloud computing; Service platform","Agricultural technology; Cloud computing; Digital storage; Genetic algorithms; Information dissemination; Information management; Information services; Agricultural economic data; Agricultural economy; Agricultural informations; Agricultural informatization; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud-computing; Economic data; Information resource; Informatization; Service platforms; Informatization","","","","","","","Alamanos A., Latinopoulos D., Papaioannou G., Et al., Integrated Hydro-Economic Modeling for Sustainable Water Resources Management in Data-Scarce Areas: The Case of Lake Karla Watershed in Greece, Water Resources Management, 33, 8, pp. 2775-2790, (2019); Chen Z., Chen J., Zhang Z., Et al., Does network governance based on banks e-commerce platform facilitate supply chain financing, China Agricultural Economic Review, 11, 4, pp. 688-703, (2019); Fang S., Jia, Tu W., Et al., Assessing Factors Driving the Change of Irrigation Water-Use Efficiency in China Based on Geographical Features, Water, 9, 10, (2017); Malik A.I., Ali M.O., Zaman M.S., Et al., Relay sowing of lentil (Lens culinaris subsp. culinaris) to intensify rice-based cropping, The Journal of Agricultural Science, 154, 5, pp. 850-857, (2016); Cheng S., Lopez M.A., Synergy analysis of agricultural economic cycle fluctuation based on ant colony algorithm, Open Physics, 16, 1, pp. 978-988, (2018); Song G., Dai C., Tan Q., Et al., Agricultural Water Management Model Based on Grey Water Footprints under Uncertainty and its Application, Sustainability, 11, 20, (2019); Lin F., Study on the optimization of market competition of potato planting industry to agricultural products economic management based on intelligent system management, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 4, pp. 1-10, (2020); Yulia P., Per H., Managing supply chain risks and delays in construction project, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 118, 7, pp. 1413-1431, (2018); Chaudhary R., Kumar N., Zeadally S., Network Service Chaining in Fog and Cloud Computing for the 5G Environment: Data Management and Security Challenges, IEEE Communications Magazine, 55, 11, pp. 114-122, (2017); Yu H., Xu H., Xu Y., Et al., Construction and evaluation of PHP-based management and training system for electrical power laboratory, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 24, 3, pp. 371-381, (2016); Reeves S.J., Construction Engineering Networks: Techniques, Planning and Management, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 41, 12, pp. 1175-1176, (2017); Park S.Y., Kim Y.S., Correlations between Construction Firm Value and Top Management Characteristics, Journal of Management in Engineering, 36, 2, (2020)","Q.

The transfer of this data to the cloud is a challenging problem because of the congestion at the network level, and therefore processing time could be too long when we use a pure cloud computing strategy. On the other hand, new applications requiring the processing of large amounts of data in real time have gradually emerged, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. These new applications have gradually won over users and developed a demand for near real-time interaction of their applications, which has completely called into question the way we process and store data. To address these two problems of congestion and computing time, edge architecture has emerged with the goal of processing data as close as possible to users, and to ensure privacy protection and responsiveness in real-time. With the continuous increase in computing power, amounts of memory and data storage at the level of smartphone and connected objects, it is now possible to process data as close as possible to sensors or directly on users devices. The coupling of these two types of processing as close as possible to the data and to the user opens up new perspectives in terms of services. In this paper, we present a new distributed edge architecture aiming to process and store Internet of Things and multimedia data close to the data producer, offering fast response time (closer to real time) in order to meet the demands of modern applications. To do this, the processing at the level of the producers of data collaborate with the processing ready for the users, establishing a new paradigm of short supply circuit for data transmission inspired of short supply chains in agriculture. The removing of unnecessary intermediaries between the producer and the consumer of the data improves efficiency. We named this new paradigm the Short Supply Circuit Internet of Things (SSCIoT). © 2022 by the authors.

Within a context of sustainable development, agroforestry can improve soil conservation and reduce the use of toxic chemicals on crops, as well as improving biodiversity. Interdisciplinary by nature, the field of agroforestry mobilizes a large body of knowledge from environmental and life sciences using systemic approaches. In this framework, field observation data are acquired in partnership with several categories of stakeholders such as scientists, foresters, farmers, breeders, politicians and land managers. For data management efficiency, we propose the software application AOBRA (a software Application with Ontology-Based Reasoning for Agroforestry). The core of AOBRA is a domain ontology called “Agroforestry” which serves as a basis for capitalizing and sharing knowledge in agroforestry. By exploiting the capabilities of inference and linkages to other areas of expertise on the Web offered by the use of an ontology model, it aims to provide a broad view of agroforestry designs, and to allow the comparison between different spatial layouts of trees and crops. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agroforestry; Knowledge management system; Ontology; OWL","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Crops; Forestry; Information management; Metadata; Ontology; Semantics; Soil conservation; Sustainable development; Agricultural landscapes; Body of knowledge; Domain ontologies; Field observation data; Management efficiency; Sharing knowledge; Software applications; Systemic approach; Application programs","","","","","","","Battle R., Kolas D., Enabling the geospatial Semantic Web with Parliamentand GeoSPARQL, Semantic Web, 3, 4, pp. 355-370, (2012); Calame M., Comprendre l’agroécologie: Origines, principes et politiques, ECLM, (2016); Domaine De Restinclières: Domaine De Restinclières Et Agroforesterie, (2020); Dufour L., Tree planting and management in agroforestry, Agroforestry for Sustainable Agriculture, P. 480 P.

The definition of an outlier event, however, is subjective and depends on the application and the domain (agriculture, healthcare, wireless network, etc.). It is important to detect outlier events as carefully as possible to avoid infrastructure failures, because anomalous events can cause minor to severe damage to infrastructure. For instance, an attack on a cyber-physical system, such as a microgrid may initiate voltage or frequency instability, thereby damaging a smart inverter, which involves very expensive repairing. Unusual activities in microgrids can be mechanical faults, behavior changes in the system, human or instrument errors or a malicious attack. Accordingly, and due to its variability, outlier detection (OD) is an ever-growing research field. In this chapter, we discuss the progress of OD methods using AI techniques. For that, the fundamental concepts of each OD model are introduced via multiple categories. Broad range of OD methods are categorized into six major categories: statistical-based, distance-based, density-based, clustering-based, learning-based, and ensemble methods. For every category, we discuss recent state-of-the-art approaches, their application areas, and performances. After that, a brief discussion regarding the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of each technique is provided with recommendations on future research directions. This survey aims to guide the reader to better understand recent progress of OD methods for the assurance of AI. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Applications of computer vision are growing in importance in livestock systems due to their ability to generate real-time, non-invasive, and accurate animal-level information. However, the development of a computer vision system requires sophisticated statistical and computational approaches for efficient data management and appropriate data mining, as it involves massive datasets. This article aims to provide an overview of how deep learning has been implemented in computer vision systems used in livestock, and how such implementation can be an effective tool to predict animal phenotypes and to accelerate the development of predictive modeling for precise management decisions. First, we reviewed the most recent milestones achieved with computer vision systems and the respective deep learning algorithms implemented in Animal Science studies. Then, we reviewed the published research studies in Animal Science which used deep learning algorithms as the primary analytical strategy for image classification, object detection, object segmentation, and feature extraction. The great number of reviewed articles published in the last few years demonstrates the high interest and rapid development of deep learning algorithms in computer vision systems across livestock species. Deep learning algorithms for computer vision systems, such as Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO (v3 and v4), DeepLab v3, U-Net and others have been used in Animal Science research studies. Additionally, network architectures such as ResNet, Inception, Xception, and VGG16 have been implemented in several studies across livestock species. The great performance of these deep learning algorithms suggests an improved predictive ability in livestock applications and a faster inference. However, only a few articles fully described the deep learning algorithms and their implementation. Thus, information regarding hyperparameter tuning, pre-trained weights, deep learning backbone, and hierarchical data structure were missing. We summarized peer-reviewed articles by computer vision tasks (image classification, object detection, and object segmentation), deep learning algorithms, animal species, and phenotypes including animal identification and behavior, feed intake, animal body weight, and many others. Understanding the principles of computer vision and the algorithms used for each application is crucial to develop efficient systems in livestock operations. Such development will potentially have a major impact on the livestock industry by predicting real-time and accurate phenotypes, which could be used in the future to improve farm management decisions, breeding programs through high-throughput phenotyping, and optimized data-driven interventions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Cattle; Machine learning; Precision farming; Swine","body weight; bovine; breeding; classification algorithm; computer vision; convolutional neural network; cow; deep learning; drinking behavior; feeding behavior; food intake; learning algorithm; livestock; nonhuman; pig; Review","","","","","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA, (2020-67015-30831, WIS03085); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA","The authors would like to acknowledge the Dairy Innovation Hub for providing the funding for D.

The Industry 4.0 concept provides various methods in this regard, including data acquisition based on IoT (Internet of Things), or data analytics based on Big Data, to support the decision-making process of the management and the data requirement of process control methods. During preliminary research, several modular data acquisition systems, as well as management applications have been developed based on a production system to measure various environmental factors at multiple spatial points. Considering the experience gained from the testing sessions, there was a need for further development regarding the end-user perspective in order to substantiate the practical application. A comparative research was required, considering previous experience and the literature of data acquisition systems, used in agriculture. The comparison concerned an own iteration of a production system and other systems, developed by researchers of the field, to examine different options and directions. Considering three important factors, the focus was on the data acquisition systems, data management, and data utilization methods. The comparison begins with a quantitative bibliometric analysis, determining the field and characteristic connections using network and cluster analysis, considering the IoT concept as the central element. Subsequently, the progression of a system and its evaluation is presented, performed in a greenhouse. This iteration highly focuses on data management with the modification of the existing infrastructure by integrating the Hadoop ecosystem to achieve a standardized interface. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; Data acquisition; Decision support; IoT; Sensor network","","","","","","","","Gebbers R., Adamchuk V.I., Precision agriculture and food security, Science, 327, 80, pp. 828-831, (2010); Global Agriculture Towards 2050, (2009); Lee M., Hwang J., Yoe H., Agricultural production system based on IoT, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 16Th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering CSE, pp. 833-837, (2013); Schuster E., Kumar S., Sarma S., Et al., Infrastructure for data-driven agriculture: Identifying management zones for cotton using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

Following PRISMA standards for systematic review, 1,182 articles were identified (published between 2018 and 2020), and 261 articles were selected for review in full. The themes investigated were: (i) data management, including data source, variables collected, granularity, and availability of the data; (ii) the statistical methods used, including analytical approach and reproducibility; and (iii) the interpretation of results, including the scope and objectives of the study, development issues addressed, scale of recommendations made relative to the scale of the sample, and the audience for recommendations. It was observed that household surveys were the most common data source and tended to be representative at the local (community) level. There was little harmonization of the variables collected between studies. Over three quarters of the studies (77%) drew on data which was not in the public domain, 14% published newly open data, and 9% drew on datasets which were already open. Other than descriptive statistics, linear and logistic regression methods were the most common analytical method used (64% of articles). In the vast majority of those articles, regression was used as an explanatory tool, as opposed to a predictive tool. More than half of the articles (59%) made claims or recommendations which extended beyond the coverage of their datasets. In combination these two common practices may lead to erroneous understanding: the tendency to rely upon simple regressions to explain context-specific and complex associations; and the tendency to generalize beyond the remit of the data collected. We make four key recommendations: (1) increased data sharing and variable harmonization would enable data to be re-used between studies; (2) providing detailed meta-data on sampling frames and study-context would enable more powerful meta-analyses; (3) methodological openness and predictive modeling could help test the transferability of approaches; (4) more precise language in study conclusions could help decision makers understand the relevance of findings for policy planning. Following these practices could leverage greater benefits from the substantial investment already made in data collection on smallholder farms.

The aim is to design and develop a control system that makes use of button sensors in a crop field with data management carried out via a web application. The three components of the system are the hardware, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, and a web application. The first component is designed and implemented as a connected control hardware box to collect crop data. The second component is a soil moisture sensor used for field monitoring, connected to the control box. Its novel feature is the moisture sensor probe designed to connect directly to the ESP8266-12F microcontroller instead of using the TLC555 IC as a traditional sensor. The final ingredient is used primarily to control crop watering via a web application, which offers the user automatic or manual control. The automatic control function uses data from the soil moisture sensor to generate a watering schedule. Comparing the two sensors’ soil moisture levels reveals approximately equal accuracy even during structural analysis and real experiments. The system proposed in this work is developed in the context of promoting digital innovation in agriculture. © 2021 IEEE.","","Automation; Capacitive sensors; Information management; Moisture control; Moisture meters; Soil moisture; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural irrigation; Control hardwares; Crop fields; Irrigation systems; Smart agricultures; Soil moisture sensors; Three-component; Watering systems; WEB application; Web applications; Crops","","","","","","","Tran K., Nguyen M., Hoang S., Et al., Wireless sensor networks and machine learning meet climate change prediction, Int J Commun Syst, (2020); Tran K., Mai M., Nguyen T.Y., Et al., Smart agriculture using IoT multi-sensors: A novel watering management system, J Sens.

Developing countries are more susceptible to food security threats due to a lack of innovation in food system production, packaging and distribution as well as the effects of climate change. It is estimated that population growth will rise by approximately 9 - 12.3 billion between 2030 and 2050 with Africa and Asia contributing the most to these figures. Countries that do not embrace innovation and change the ways of working in agriculture can find themselves not being able to compete in global markets as the cost of producing food using old methods will impact competitiveness and market linkages. Literature reveals that although most developed countries are looking at innovating and implement climate-friendly ways of producing food through the application of digital technologies however low adoption and due to lack of policy framework are affecting progress especially in developing countries. When compared to other industries, the agricultural sector is progressing slower in adopting Fourth Industrial Revolution practices. Cost and unclear value add of digital technology, data management, education, and skills; social issues such as increased unemployment and policy are cited as the biggest blockers to adoption. Furthermore, innovative agricultural practices such as precision agriculture and digital technologies are being applied in a silo approach rather than looking at the entire agriculture value chain to optimize it and foster collaboration. A gap analysis done on implementation of agriculture technologies in South Africa shows that there is little research done in digital agriculture and also reveals that it follows the silo approach. No study currently in South Africa has looked at the holistic approach of applying digital technologies in the value chain and how data collected can be analyzed and used to create visibility of the value chain and enhance performance and collaboration. The expected outcome of this study is the development of the digital agricultural strategy best practices for South Africa for the entire value chain that can inform and influence the policy framework. For the purposes of this study, the digital agriculture conceptual framework to be developed will be piloted on the maize value chain. This digital framework will be modelled to test different scenarios and assumption to demonstrate the value add of lack of implementing digital technologies in the agriculture value chain. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

However, there has not been significant work on the comprehensive and sequential applications of blockchain integrated IoT in e-agriculture for data validation, data storage, data security and data privacy. We aim to bridge this gap in the literature and discuss how the integration of blockchain and IoT can improve backward and forward linkages in agricultural value chains, benefit value chain actors, and augment the performance of IoT network. The study considers use cases of agriculture inputs and commodities/products to demonstrate the application of IoT devices in data collection and blockchain technology for data validation, data storage, data security, and data transmission. RAFT consensus algorithm for permission blockchain and FAIR principles are utilized to make e-agriculture information systems decentralized, efficient, fault tolerant, and interoperable. The technology coupling in e-agriculture can create externalities such as shared benefits, improved coordination between value chain actors, and real-time decision-making for optimal resource allocation and their sustainable utilization in e-agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Distributed ledger technology; e-agriculture; FAIR data Principles; Internet-of-Things; RAFT Consensus; Smart function","Agriculture; Blockchain; Data privacy; Decision making; Digital storage; Economics; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Interoperability; Network architecture; Block-chain; Data storage; Data validation; Distributed ledg technology; E agricultures; FAIR data principle; RAFT consensus; Smart function; Validation data; Value chains; Internet of things","","","","","","","Aayog N., Blockchain–The India Strategy Part I: towards enabling ease of business, ease of living, and ease of governance, (2020); Ali S., Wang G., White B., Cottrell R.L., August.

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols.

Meanwhile, each entity within these connected environments carries its unique requirements and individual goals. For connected environments to gain greater legitimacy among end users, service-oriented systems must adopt a new paradigm that allows end users to move from being passive consumers to actively participate in monitoring their own data at different stages of its lifecycle. In this context, a usage model based on ontological reasoning can be integrated within a data provenance mechanism to help create a trust worthy environment. In this paper, we introduce a vision for democratizing service-oriented systems. We discuss potential new directions that need to be pursued in the area of data management. Then, we review existing schemes applied in IoT data provenance and rely on the requirements to discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

Among them, precision dairy technology can be one of the most important ways to realize the modern dairy industry. Farm management can be transformed from the group to the individual for high efficiency and production level. However, the current adoption of precision dairy technology was still lacking so far. Most research was focused on the influencing factors of technology application and development. Only a few explored the current adoption of precision dairy technology. This study aims to investigate the adoption behavior of precision dairy technology by dairy farmers. The research areas were selected as the dairy-producing bases in North China (Hebei Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province, and Shanxi Province). 345 valid samples were firstly collected for the latter use. A binary Logit regression was then used to construct the theoretical framework for the farmers' adoption of precision dairy technology, according to the farmers' behavior and innovation diffusion theory. The results showed that: 1) The adoption rates of automatic cup stripping, identification, milk recording, and estrus monitoring technology by dairy farmers were 64.9%, 57.7%, 56.2%, and 37.7%, respectively. 2) The non-adoption of new technologies was ever more costly for dairy farmers, particularly for the unaffordable investment in the early stage of technology. 3) All technology popularization levels, breeding scales, and average daily milk production presented a significant positive correlation on the adoption of four technologies. By contrast, there was a significant correlation with the other factors on the adoption of at least two technologies. Among the four technologies, the automatic cup stripping technology was the least affected by the breeding scale, policy subsidies, and technical training. The automatic identification technology was the most affected by the satisfaction of breeding income and education level. The automatic milk recording technology was the most affected by the average daily milk production, and policy subsidies without technical training. The automatic estrus monitoring technology was the least affected by the education level and average daily milk production without the policy subsidies, particularly the most influence from the breeding scale and technical training. Therefore, it is recommended to implement the different promotion measures for the four technologies. Specifically, the automatic cup stripping technology can be focused on small-scale farms, due to the least influence from the farming scale. The automatic estrus monitoring technology can be focused on large-scale breeding farms, technical popularization, and training for the strong skills of data management for the dairy farmers. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

It is the data that is sensed, measured, and transmitted by sensors with real-time and dynamic characteristics. With the development of the IoT and big data technologies, new industries such as smart transportation, smart cities, and smart agriculture have gradually formed, resulting in an increasing demand for large-scale data analysis and calculations. However, the storage architecture based on relational databases has been unable to meet the current needs in terms of data storage and data read and write speed. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the sensor data management system based on distributed storage, builds a Hadoop cluster, proposes a storage structure that combines the relational database MySQL with the distributed database HBase, designs a data migration module to satisfy real-time sensor data monitoring and massive data storage requirements. In order to meet the needs of enterprises in actual production, SSM framework technology is used to build a sensor data management platform, covering the functions of system management, sensor data management, data exception management, sensor data real-time monitoring, sensor node status monitoring, data statistical analysis, etc. The platform has good security and reliability, and can effectively improve the management efficiency of the enterprise. Finally, the experiment provides that the system has obvious advantages in data upload and query ability compared with the traditional storage architecture. It provides a good data environment for data analysis and data mining in the future. © 2020 IEEE.","distributed storage; HBase; sensor data; SSM","Agricultural robots; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Internet of things; Memory architecture; Monitoring; Query processing; Relational database systems; Reliability analysis; Search engines; Sensor nodes; Storage management; Data statistical analysis; Dynamic characteristics; Internet of thing (IOT); Large-scale data analysis; Management efficiency; Security and reliabilities; Sensor data management; Storage architectures; Information management","","","","","","","Wang B., Summary of research on internet of tilings technology [J], Journal of Electronic Measurement and Instrument, 23, 12, pp. 1-7, (2009); Sohu I.T., Garnter predicts that there will be 26 billion iot devices in 2020 [eb/ol] china academy of information and communications technology, ""internet of things white paper (2018)""[J], Automation Expo, 35, 12, (2018); Ghemawat S., Gobioff H., Leung S.-T., The Google File System, pp. 29-43, (2003); Shvachko K., Kuang H., Radia S., Chansler R., The hadoop distributed file system, Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST), 2010 Ieee 26th Symposium on, (2010); Apache Hadoop; Amazon S3; Apache HBase; Chang F., Dean J., Ghemawat S., Hsieh W.C., Wallach D.A., Burrows M., 2008 Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data, Acm Trans.

With the implementation of Geographic Information Systems, the technologies used in the maintenance of the state land cadastre are changing significantly, and electronic resources are the highest priority. Uzbekistan is actively working to modernize the existing 'paper' cadastral registration system by creating a National Geographic Information System and a modern Integrated Cadastral Information System and real estate registration as part of electronic government using geoinformation and Web-technologies. As a result, a database was created and this cadastral information system was successfully tested as an effective tool for data management, operational interdepartmental integration of information, as well as for making effective decisions in the field of land management and regional development planning.

The information system begins to receive new data that needs to be processed, stored and analyzed. There is a need to review and modify existing software to solve new problems related to information data management and implementation of management and forecasting functions. It is advisable for agricultural enterprises to use planning information systems, the model of which will be based on data architecture, systems and technologies. This will help improve the quality of planning in agriculture. Modification in the architecture of agricultural enterprise information systems planning can as well positively influence efficiency of use of precise farming systems and smart technologies in the future. The study substantiates the structure of the information system planning in agriculture and gives its description. The stages connected with improvement in modeling of architecture of the agricultural enterprise information system planning on the basis of possible scenarios of changes in system of data collecting and processing for further administrative decisions are offered. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The shortcomings of the currently available methods for manually measuring LAI include labor-intensive, low sampling frequency, and asynchronous data collection. Focusing on these issues, a LAI sensor based on hemispherical photogrammetry and an automatic network observation system (LAI-NOS) for LAI were developed, which consists of four parts: LAI sensor, sensor node, sink node, and online data management system. The LAI sensor measures LAI values based on hemispherical photography. The sensor node is responsible for controlling the sensor and obtaining the data measured by the LAI sensor. The sink node is responsible for local networking and communication with the remote server. Data storage, data management, data display, and sampling frequency are managed by the online data management system. Comparative studies with LAI-2200C and satellite products were also conducted in this study. The comparative study with LAI-2200C showed that the LAI measurements of different vegetation types from both sources were highly significantly correlated whether based on Pearson regression or Passing & Bablok regression. A preliminary study comparing LAI-NOS measurements with Sentinel-2 inversion LAI and MODIS LAI products (MOD15A2H) showed (1) all LAI-NOS nodes measurements agreed very well with Sentinel-2 inversion LAI in the experimental period (average R2=0.94, RMSE=0.41); (2) the possible overestimate of Sentinel-2 inversion LAI was found in the middle stage of wheat (jointing-anthesis); (3) MOD15A2H and LAI-NOS measurements showed similar crop growth trends in long-term observations. © 2022","Hemispherical photography; Leaf area index; MOD15A2H; Sentinel-2; Wireless sensor network","artificial neural network; comparative study; data management; leaf area index; MODIS; photogrammetry; photography; satellite altimetry; sensor; Sentinel; wheat","","","","","National Civil Space Infrastructure Land Observation Satellite Common Application Support Platform, (Y930280A2F); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2019YJ0201)","We would like to acknowledge the support of the Yucheng site, the Nanjing site, and the Changchun site.

These data are highly sensitive and need to be securely stored and protected against unauthorized access. The farmers can communicate with the intelligent decision support system using the mobile app and web applications to get information about the land from domain experts. The proposed system used blockchain technology to provide privacy, security, easy accessibility, and availability of information to the people to use natural resources effectively and reduce the effect of soil and water pollution by using pesticides and fertilizer based on data stored in the knowledge base. We have implemented a knowledge discovery system using the platform hyperledger for efficient storage and sharing of sensor data which provides security and data privacy. Precision agriculture with IoT and Edge computing allows people and devices to be connected anywhere, anytime in a smart cloud environment to provide intelligent service to the farmers. © 2022 The Authors.

The adoption of Smart Farming and its connected services and techniques accelerates agriculture's dependence on data, yet the process of creating value from data is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: What assets and management decisions comprise the process of creating value from data? What are the properties of this process, and where should resources be invested to increase the value created from agricultural data? METHODS: We extend platform economics theory with the results from a recent systematic literature review of Big Data in Smart Farming to show the creation of value from data occurs in Data Sharing Platforms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Data sharing platforms are systems that connect the layers of the ‘platform stack’ with pertinent management tasks to create value from data. We illustrate this arrangement as a sectioned, three-circle Venn Diagram and evaluate the efficacy of common data management techniques in the creation of value from data. This paper concludes that value is created from data only when each of the components of data sharing platforms are present and that the operation of a data sharing platform describes the process that takes data as an input and produces value as an output. Further conclusions relate to commercial and institutional aspects of the creation of value from Smart Farming data. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed model is useful for evaluating production processes that create value from data. This paper details several avenues for extension. Productive models of systems that rely on data as a core asset may now be assembled. Policies that trade off technical characteristics of data with social impacts of data may now be approached. Questions surrounding data ownership may be considered with greater clarity. © 2021","big data; data sharing platforms; datanomics; platform economics; Smart Farming; value of data","agricultural policy; data management; literature review; ownership; theoretical study; trade-off","","","","","","","AgriDigital, Waypath, (2021); Agyekumhene C., De Vries J., Paassen A.V., Schut M., MacNaghten P., Making smallholder value chain partnerships inclusive: exploring digital farm monitoring through farmer friendly smartphone platforms, Sustainability, 12, 11, (2020); Arrow K.J., The economics of information: an exposition, Empirica, 23, 2, pp. 119-128, (1996); Baker D., Cook S., Jackson E.L., Wysel M., Wynn M., Leonard E., Investment in agri-food digital transformation: avoiding the technical fallacy, Paper presented at the 65th Annual Conference of the Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society, Sydney, Australia, (2021); Barrett C.B., Overcoming global food security challenges through science and solidarity, Am.

In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature. Our results show that data filtering reduces the amount of data sent by the fog to the cloud.  © 2020 IEEE.","data filtering; fog computing; Internet of things; machine learning; smart agriculture","Agricultural robots; Fog; Fog computing; Forestry; Information management; Irrigation; Nearest neighbor search; Timber; Agricultural yields; Computing solutions; Connectivity problems; Intermittent connectivity; Internet of thing (IOT); K nearest neighbor (KNN); Run-length encoding; Temperature and humidities; Internet of things","","","","","European Commission in Europe; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranhão; IFMA; MCTIC/RNP; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (777112)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research has been jointly funded by the European Commission in Europe and MCTIC/RNP in Brazil, under the EUB-02-2017 IoT Pilots call.

Concurrent with 60% increases in food production demands by 2050 and the need for sustainable intensification, is the increased need for data synthesis across temporal and spatial scales. Therefore, in our data-rich world, what is lacking is a data management system across spatial and temporal resolutions including workflows, interpretation methodology, and a delivery structure for identifying optimal systems for sustainable intensification or diversification. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to explore the current state of handling spatially and temporally disparate data and offer solutions for developing a platform for bridging component parts (encompassing multiple scales and disciplines) to analyze system functionality for greater resiliency, which may help manage risk. Two datasets were generated using bibliometrics (research articles from systematic literature reviews) evaluated trends and historical Big Data applications in agronomy. Results indicate research and industry progress is advancing towards web-based real-time output delivery systems using several well-established Big Data handling platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), which are not yet widely used by or designed for agronomic researchers. Cloud-based computing may provide opportunities to extrapolate agricultural research results across larger scales. Authors suggest training and educating agricultural practitioners on Big Data principles, database management, improved data visualization, as well as incentives for data sharing for optimizing Big Data in systems agriculture as these research innovations emerge. © 2020 The Authors.

Nowadays, agricultural practices are done by statistical and quantitative approaches. It is important to protect the data which are collected in the agricultural sector. Blockchain is one of the promising technologies that are used for the data encryption. Blockchain is used to store the transaction data. A huge amount of data is stored in IPFS, which ensures scalability and data confidentiality. It also ensures data privacy with the data sharing mechanism. The data collected from the agricultural sectors like moisture content of the soil, temperature, and crop status that are obtained from the IoT sensors on the agricultural land, other details such as previous year agricultural records, details of the agricultural land, yield, logistics, and so on are passed to the blockchain and so that the data cannot be used for malpractices. These data are helpful for the farmers to cultivate the crops according to their land conditions. This data can also be analyzed so that the farmer can get an estimate from the government and insurance organizations to meet his needs. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used for secure storage of this large quantity of information. This chapter presents a completely secure blockchain-based framework for smart farming using IoT sensors and a farmer support system to meet certain necessities of the farmer. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Blockchain; Data management; IoT; IPFS; Smart farming","","","","","","","","Aryal J.P., Sapkota T.B., Rahut D.B., Jat M.L., Agricultural sustainability under emerging climatic variability: The role of climate-smart agriculture and relevant policies in India, Int.

In monitoring and implementing FMRs, issues like FMR project duplication, overlapping, and segmentation of road FMR constructions arise. IROAD or Integrated Road on Agricultural Development initially addresses these concerns. It is an online interactive MIS that aims to consolidate, store/manage, and analyze GIS-based data of DA and other National Government Agencies' FMR projects. However, it is limited only to filtering and viewing Agricultural and Fisheries Infrastructure (AFI) projects according to specific criteria. Also, the process of map rendering and visualization is slow and laggy. These limitations mark developing a more sophisticated web GIS application that can facilitate the visualization and analysis of FMR implementations. The utilization of Free and Opensource Software (FOSS) like GeoDjango, GeoServer, PostgreSQL/PostGIS satisfies the storage and visualization requirements of the system. User experience was made easy in terms of data management and generation of reports with the help of readily available scripting and styling libraries like Leaflet, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The application is advantageous not just for the community of FMR beneficiaries but also to the stakeholders and various implementing agencies, as this builds an FMR information system among themselves.  © 2021 IEEE.","Farm to Market Road; Geo Visualization.; GeoDjango; Leaflet; PostGIS; Web GIS","Agriculture; Commerce; Geographic information systems; Highway planning; Information management; Open source software; Roads and streets; Visualization; Design and Development; Farm to market road; Geo visualization.; Geodjango; Geovisualization; Leaflet; Philippines; PostGIS; Road projects; Web-GIS; Digital storage","","","","","","","Farm-to-market Roads: A Farmer's Journey, (2021); Revised General Guidelines on the Implementation of the Department of Agriculture Farm-to-Market Roads Development Program (DA-FMRDP), (2020); Republic Act No. 8435 | Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, (2021); Republic Act No. 10601 | Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, (2021); RA8435 Chapter 2 Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan; Iroad, (2021); Agrawal S., Gupta R.D., Development and comparison of Open Source based web GIS frameworks on WAMP and Apache Tomcat web servers, Int.

To realize operational efficiency, full automation, and high productivity in agricultural systems, different kinds of data are collected from operational systems using different sensors, stored in different systems, and processed using advanced techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning. Due to the complexity of data management operations, a data management reference architecture is required. While there are different initiatives to design data management reference architectures, a data management reference architecture for sustainable agriculture is missing. In this study, we follow domain scoping, domain modeling, and reference architecture design stages to design the reference architecture for sustainable agriculture. Four case studies were performed to demonstrate the applicability of the reference architecture. This study shows that the proposed data management reference architecture is practical and effective for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this research is to better understand the current positioning of U.S. commercial corn and soybean farms within the farm data lifecycle, including the collection, use, and impact of farm data. Using survey data from a sample of 800 commercial-scale U.S. corn and soybean farms, the factors associated with progression within the farm data lifecycle are examined. Results indicate that the majority of commercial U.S. corn and soybean farms collect data, indicate that the data they collect influences their decisions, and perceive positive yield benefits as a result of their data-informed decisions. However, farms vary in intensity of their data usage. Investments in data management and analysis resources are associated with progression within the farm data lifecycle. These investments comprise software products that manage and analyze data, including creating GPS maps, layering different data sources, and generating recommendations. Investments in human capital, either in on-farm employees with designated data responsibilities or in trusted off-farm service providers, are also associated with progression within the farm data lifecycle. Farms that have not yet invested in these types of data management and data analysis resources may be forfeiting the potential benefits associated with using their farm’s data to improve on-farm decision making. © 2021, The Author(s).","Commercial farms; Corn and soybeans; Digital agriculture; Farm data lifecycle; Precision agriculture","Glycine max; data management; decision making; farm; GPS; life cycle; maize; soybean","","","","","Center for Commercial Agriculture; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA, (1019254)","This research was supported by funding from the Center for Commercial Agriculture and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch project 1019254.

Although beneficial, collecting and analyzing the environmental data is an expensive and complicated endeavor. Numerous existing wireless sensor network (WSN) solutions rely on protocols such as 802.15.4 b (LR-WPANs) and 802.11x (WLAN) but provide limited transmission range, complex communication stacks and data management, and high power consumption. Additionally, many existing services introduce challenges with data ownership and residency. These factors present a high barrier to entry for growers. The resources required to implement and maintain sensor networks are too high to justify the investment. This work presents an approach that uses inexpensive and effective hardware that is easily setup and maintained. Costs to implement the network are reduced through the use of open-source hardware. Transmission ranges and power consumption are improved by using long range (LoRa) radio transceivers. By addressing these limitations, growers will be better enabled to adopt new technologies, ultimately improving sustainability, viability, quality and profit margins in agriculture.

The importance of the value of data makes it inevitable to combine blockchain, AI, and IoT. The convergence of these technologies will create a unique path for new business design models. The IoT devices like sensors, machines, cars, trucks, cameras which are termed as autonomous agents will act as the future profit-making centers that (i) have the digital twin controlling IoT, (ii) use the blockchain technology to transfer money automatically, (iii) autonomously derive a conclusion like self-governing economic agents using data analytics and AI. It is further argued that the triple convergence will enable the creation of such independent decisionmaking business models, which will be the beginning of a revolution in industrial corporations. The transformation of the business models by using these emerging technologies is necessary to improve the quality of life of the people. In this chapter, we study the importance of the amalgamation of these key technologies that improve the privacy, scalability, security, authentication, and automatization of business data models. We also present various use cases of convergence of these three technologies for better understanding. © 2022 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

Based on the analysis of greenhouse planting demand and environmental factors, the intelligent agriculture monitoring system is established based on the IoT, and the greenhouse system controller is designed based on the adaptive proportion integration differentiation (PID) algorithm. The noise data removal method is established based on the furthest priority strategy k-means (FPKM) algorithm, and the greenhouse data management system is established mainly by the business platform and management platform. The data set of air temperature during the cultivation of Flammulina velutifolia in a factory from October 2020 to January 2021 was selected as the research data to analyse the ability of the IoT-based IARMM system to collect greenhouse temperature, carbon dioxide, and light data. In addition, the application of the greenhouse data management system in greenhouse data monitoring and control is analysed. The processing capability of agricultural environment monitoring data based on the FPKM algorithm is analysed. The results show that the intelligent agriculture monitoring system based on IoT and machine learning can effectively monitor the data on greenhouse temperature, carbon dioxide, light, and other environmental factors, and the greenhouse data management system can effectively ensure the normal operation of equipment and data storage. After being processed by the FPKM algorithm, outliers are identified and effectively removed. Under random seeds, the iteration times of the FPKM algorithm and the k-means algorithm are significantly different. The iteration number of the FPKM algorithm is basically stable at approximately 2 times, while the iteration number of the k-means algorithm obviously fluctuates. Based on the IoT and FPKM algorithm, the intelligent agriculture monitoring system covering the user monitoring center, data center module, and mobile phone client module is established. This work establishes a practical remote monitoring and management system for intelligent agriculture based on the IoT and machine learning algorithm, which provides a new idea for intelligent agricultural management.  © 2022 Meirong Zhu and Jie Shang.","","Adaptive control systems; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Deep learning; Digital storage; Environmental management; Greenhouses; Information management; Iterative methods; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Monitoring; Remote control; Agriculture monitoring; Data management system; K-mean algorithms; Management systems; Monitoring and management systems; Monitoring system; Plantings; Priority strategy; Remote management; Remote monitoring system; Internet of things","","","","","","","Jin Y.R., Ji S., Mapping hotspots and emerging trends of business model innovation under networking in Internet of Things, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2018, 1, (2018); Deng X., Sun R., Yang H., Nie J., Wang W., Data transmission method of pasture internet of things based on opportunistic network, Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 48, 2, pp. 208-214, (2018); Wei Y.X., Study on the application of internet of things-based intelligent microscope in blood cell analysis, Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience, 14, 2, pp. 1199-1203, (2017); Kumar P.M., Gandhi U., Varatharajan R., Manogaran G., Jidhesh R., Vadivel T., Intelligent face recognition and navigation system using neural learning for intelligent security in internet of things, Cluster Computing, 22, 4, pp. 7733-7744, (2017); Jie L., Wei Y., Nan Z., Yang X., Zhang H., Wei Z., A survey on internet of things: Architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy, and applications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 4, 5, pp. 1125-1142, (2017); Lv Z., Han Y., Singh A.K., Manogaran G., Lv H., Trustworthiness in industrial IoT systems based on artificial intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 17, 2, pp. 1496-1504, (2021); Lv Z., Security of internet of things edge devices, Software: Practice and Experience, 51, 12, pp. 2446-2456, (2021); Alshehri M.D., Hussain F.K., Hussain O.K., Clustering-driven intelligent trust management methodology for the internet of things (CITM-IoT), Mobile Networks & Applications, 23, 3, pp. 419-431, (2018); Wan J., Tang S., Hua Q., Di L., Liu C., Lloret J., Context-aware cloud robotics for material handling in cognitive industrial internet of things, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 4, pp. 2272-2281, (2017); Sundaravadivel P., Kougianos E., Mohanty S.P., Ganapathiraju M.K., Everything you wanted to know about smart health care: Evaluating the different technologies and components of the internet of things for better health, IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine, 7, 1, pp. 18-28, (2018); Rodrigues J.J.P.C., Wang X., Sangaiah A.K., Sheng M., Guest editorial special issue on integrated computing: Computational intelligence paradigms and internet of things for industrial applications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 3, pp. 1572-1574, (2018); Yuqing L., Jiajia L.S., Shouqi C., Bowen X., Design and application of monitoring system for crab breeding base based on internet of things, Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 34, 16, pp. 205-213, (2018); Man C., Guo L., Gao Y., Zhang Y., Wisdom Farm Internet of Things Software Design and Selection Program, pp. 791-798; Saeedi I.D.I., Al-Qurabat A.K.M., Perceptually important points-based data aggregation method for wireless sensor networks, Baghdad Science Journal, 35, (2022); Al-Qurabat A.K.M., Mohammed Z.A., Hussein Z.J., Data traffic management based on compression and MDL techniques for smart agriculture in IoT, Wireless Personal Communications, 120, 3, pp. 2227-2258, (2021); Lin J., Shen Z., Zhang A., Chai Y., Blockchain and IoT Based Food Traceability for Smart Agriculture, pp. 1-6; Saeedi I.D.I., Al-Qurabat A.K.M., A systematic review of data aggregation techniques in wireless sensor networks, Journal of Physics: Conference Series.

Aquaponics is a highly efficient way of farming and is becoming increasingly popular. However, large scale aquaponics still lack stability, standardization and proof of economical profitability. The EU-INAPRO project helps to overcome these limitations byintroducing digitization, enhanced technology, and developing standardized modular scalable solutions and demonstrating the viability of large aquaponics. INAPRO is based on an innovation a double water recirculation system (DRAPS), one for fish, and the other one for crops. In DRAPS, optimum conditions can be set up individually for fish and crops to increase productivity of both. Moreover, the integration of digital technologies and data management in the aquaculture production and processing systems will enable full traceability and transparency in the processes, increasing consumers'trust in aquaculture products. In this paper, the innovations and the digitization approach will beintroduced and explained and the key benefits of the system will be emphasized.  © 2021 Karimanzira and Rauschenbach.","aquaponics; artificial intelligence; intelligent management; zero-positive diagnostics","","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (619137)","","Loic B., Van Loi C.

IoT utilizes the Internet as a prime medium of communication for both single documents as well as multi-digital messages. However, due to the wide-open nature of the Internet, it is important to ensure the anonymity, untraceably, confidentiality, and unforgeability of communication with efficient computational complexity and low bandwidth. We designed a light weight and secure proxy blind signcryption for multi-digital messages based on a hyperelliptic curve (HEC). Our results outperform the available schemes in terms of computational cost and communication bandwidth. The designed scheme also has the desired authentication, unforgeability of warrants and/or plaintext, confidentiality, integrity, and blindness, respectively. Further, our scheme is more suitable for devices with low computation power such as mobiles and tablets. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

As one of the core technologies of DA and SA, crop growth model can dynamically simulate crop growth and development processes and their relationships with climate condition, soil characteristics and management strategy, so as to overcome the limitation of the spatial-temporal characteristics of traditional research on agricultural production management. It can provide powerful quantitative tools for crop productivity prediction and early warning and impact evaluation under different conditions. Through over 20-years systematic and profound exploration and practicing in wheat and rice crops, and based on the workflow of “physiological mechanism analysis-model algorithm development-dynamic productivity prediction-quantitative effect assessment-simulation platform development”, our research team has been devoted to the development and application of crop simulation model CropGrow, by integrating the technologies of system analysis, dynamic modeling, virtual reality, scenario simulation, and decision support. Firstly, based on the system analysis method and dynamic modeling technology, the comprehensive and mechanistic crop growth model CropGrow has been developed, including the submodels of phasic development and phenology, organ development and population establishment, photosynthetic production and biomass accumulation, assimilate partitioning and yield/quality formation, nutrient dynamics, and water balance, along with three-dimensional morphological and visual submodels, which could digitalize and visualize the processes of crop growth and productivity formation under different conditions. Further, by coupling geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), the model-based regional crop productivity prediction technology has been established. Then, based on the scenario analysis, the contributions of climate change, soil improvement, variety updating, and strategy optimization to regional crop production have been quantified, and applications extended to generation of suitable management plan, design of ideal cultivar, assessment of climate impact, evaluation of land use and decision-making of agricultural policy. Finally, based on the component-based programming technology, a model-based digital and visual crop growth simulation system and decision support platform has been developed by integrating the crop production database and crop model components, further realizing the comprehensive functions of data management, parameter optimization, growth simulation, remote sensing coupling, regional prediction, management strategy design, effect evaluation, safety early warning and product release. In the future, based on the improvement of agro-information database, additional efforts in crop modeling will be made toward enhancing prediction ability, quantifying gene effects, developing intelligent decision-making, and coupling multiple models, which will provide digital support for the prediction and early warning of food production, quantitative evaluation of scenario effects, decision-making on management strategy, and optimal design of new crop cultivars, thus facilitating the security of national food and development of digital agriculture. © 2020 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

With progress in crop and input monitoring systems and price reductions over the past decade, data are now being captured at an unprecedented rate. Once compiled, organized and analyzed, these data are capable of providing valuable insights into much of the agri-food supply chain. While much of the focus is on precision farming, agricultural data applications coupled with gene editing tools hold the potential to enhance crop performance and global food security. Yet, digitization of agriculture is a double-edged sword as it comes with inherent security and privacy quandaries. Infrastructure, policies, and practices to better harness the value of data are still lacking. This article reports expert opinions about the potential challenges regarding the use of data relevant to the development and approval of new crop traits as well as mechanisms employed to manage and protect data. While data could be of great value, issues of intellectual property and accessibility surround many of its forms. The key finding of this research is that surveyed experts optimistically report that by 2030, the synergy of computing power and genome editing could have profound effects on the global agri-food system, but that the European Union may not participate fully in this transformation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Big data; Data management; Food security; Harmonization; Innovation; Privacy","Agriculture; Expert Testimony; Food Supply; Gene Editing; Genome, Plant; Plants; agriculture; catering service; expert witness; gene editing; genetics; plant; plant genome","","","","","Imaging Research Centre; P2IRC; Canada First Research Excellence Fund, CFREF","Funding text 1: This research was undertaken with funding from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) that established the Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Centre (P2IRC) project. ; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF) that established the Plant Phenotyping and Imaging Research Centre (P2IRC) project.

Processing this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud, Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput, Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. © 2021 The Authors","Agriculture 4.0; Blockchain; Data house; Data lake; Dew computing; Edge computing; Fog computing; Kappa architecture; Lambda architecture; Micro-service architecture; Osmotic computing; Smart agriculture; Smart farming","","","","","","Infortech and Numediart institutes","This research is partially funded by Infortech and Numediart institutes.

The objective of this work was to highlight critical points of DM quality and its implications for studies in agriculture and livestock. The literature reports problems of accuracy, completeness and consistency in the quality of some datasets, being also apparent issues related to the dimensions of temporality and trustiness of these data. Considering the origin of these problems, issues were observed both from the DM collection systems and from the sensors used. In conclusion, DM quality studies applied in the agricultural and zootechnical context, although current, are still few, being considered an issue for data management in these fields. © 2020 AISTI.","bioclimatology; climate; data management; data quality; livestock production; plant production","Agricultural robots; Crops; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Agricultural crops; Collection systems; Farm animals; Livestock production; Meteorological data; Meteorology","","","","","","","Ryu M., Et al., Design and implementation of a connected farm for smart farming system, Sensors, pp. 1-4, (2015); De Medeiros R.M., Et al., Temperatura média do ar e suas flutuaçoes no Estado de Pernambuco, Brasil, Revista Brasileira de Meio Ambiente, 2, 1, pp. 81-93, (2018); Pereira L.S., Et al., Crop evapotranspiration estimation with FAO56: Past and future, Agricultural Water Management, 147, pp. 4-20, (2015); Sun S., Et al., Revisiting the evolution of the 2009-2011 meteorological drought over Southwest China, Journal of Hydrology, 568, pp. 385-402, (2019); Bett B., Et al., Effects of climate change on the occurrence and distribution of livestock diseases, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 137, pp. 119-129, (2017); Collier R.J., Gebremedhin K.G., Thermal biology of domestic animals, Annual Review of Animal Biosciences, 3, 1, pp. 513-532, (2015); Ozkan, Et al., Challenges and priorities for modelling livestock health and pathogens in the context of climate change, Environmental Research, 151, pp. 130-144, (2016); Juran J.M., Godfrey A.B., Juran's Quality Handbook, (1999); Firmani D., Et al., On the meaningfulness of big data quality, Data Science and Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 6-20, (2016); Pipino L.L., Et al., Data quality assessment, Communications of the ACM, 45, 4, pp. 211-218, (2002); Nese J.M., Systematic biases in manual observations of daily maximum and minimum temperature, Journal of Climate, 7, 5, pp. 834-842, (1994); Hay S.I., Lennon J.J., Deriving meteorological variables across Africa for the study and control of vectorborne disease: A comparison of remote sensing and spatial interpolation of climate, Tropical Medicine & International Health, 4, 1, pp. 58-71, (1999); Perez I.A., Et al., Comparison between measurements obtained with a meteorological mast and a RASS sodar, Proc.

The exponential growth of the data management of smart farming is a key factor in modern agricultural systems, which helps in critical decision making. Through Wireless sensor networks, the objective data is gathered and could aim for maximum sustainability. The crop productivity depends on two factors namely, maximum profitable production and minimal negative environmental impact. One of the alternative artificial supplements of nutrients in the modern diet includes the Zinc (Zn) enriched sprout. Sowing of seeds with Zn helps to improvise the modern diet and many vital functions of the human body. The robotic solutions with Artificial Intelligence with the data sets of agricultural techniques set the base level for sustainable growth in the area of agriculture in the future. This paper reviews existing systems followed by farm management with each step from the growth of the seed since sowing to the variable rate applications. The different level of Zn content in different sprouts is discussed. Such a methodology allows farm owners to decide various parameters economically and optimally without harming the eco-system and enables transformation towards sustainable food production for matching the future population growth. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Digital Horticulture; Homesteads; Precision Agriculture (PA); Ranchers; Wireless Sensor Networks; Zinc enriched sprout","Agricultural robots; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision making; Environmental impact; Growth rate; Population statistics; Profitability; Seed; Sustainable development; Wireless sensor networks; Zinc; Agricultural system; Agricultural techniques; Crop productivity; Exponential growth; Population growth; Robotic solutions; Sustainable growth; Variable rate application; Information management","","","","","","","Sarni W., Mariani J., Kaji J., From dirt to data: The second green revolution and iot, Deloitte Insights, (2019); Tzounis A., Katsoulas N., Bartzanas T., Kittitas C., Internet of things in agriculture, recent advances and future challenges, Biosyst.

In the field of agriculture, big data has also presented the promising potential to promote the terminals of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System on agricultural machinery in China. However, the current management can be decentralized fail to form the nationwide operation of agricultural machinery using the big data system and service scheme, due mainly to the rapid increase of the data. In this study, a new big data system of BeiDou terminals was developed to compile, the data transmission specifications of platform-to-platform for the nationwide dynamic monitoring and quantitative statistical analysis of agricultural machinery operations in China. Three parts of the big data system were also installed in the agricultural machinery of the manufacturers. The first part was involved the agricultural machinery and the BeiDou/GNSS terminals. The second part was the Internet of Things (IoTs) platform for agricultural machinery for manufacturers. The third part was the big data management and service platform for the agricultural machinery operation by the BeiDou Team of China Agricultural University. Specifically, the BeiDou terminals were used to collect the position and working condition data of agricultural machinery. The gathered information was forwarded in real time to the manufacturers, then to the big data management and service platform. There were 290 153 sets of agricultural machinery in the big data system. Data mining and statistical analysis were performed on the big data management and service platform. The information products were generated to process the operation data on the big data management and service platform using three major procedures, including data cleaning, trajectory segmentation, and parameter extraction. In addition, the basic statistics were achieved, such as the working hours, driving mileage, and working area. Taking the trajectory data generated by the wheat harvester in North China from May 31 to June 26, 2021, as an example, a further examination was conducted to verify the applicability and efficiency of the big data system. The heat map and operation center of gravity transfer diagram in the harvesters were established to extract the harvesting parameters of time, efficiency, and harvesting area. The dependence on cross-regional harvesters was then determined in the main wheat-producing areas. It was found that there were 35 243 sets of online wheat harvesters during harvesting, with a daily average of 18 568 sets. The average daily harvesting duration was approximately 8.3 h, and the harvesting area was roughly 5.5 hm2/d. Besides, around 75% of the wheat harvesters were accomplished the cross-zone mechanized harvest, 69% of which presented a cross-zone distance (Euclidean distance) of more than 300 km, and an average of 597 km. More than 50% of the fields were harvested by the harvesters in Hubei and Hebei Province. The big data system was implemented the full connection with the 290 153 sets of agricultural machinery at the end of November, 2021. As such, the location and working condition data were integrated from the major manufacturers of agricultural machinery. The big data system can be widely expected to accurately evaluate the data processing and operation. The finding can also provide for the dynamic and real-time monitoring of agricultural machinery operation and data analysis services in modern agriculture. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this framework, this tendency must be reverted by adopting different farm management policies. The MAN4HEALTH project address this subject in two-folds: one, at an agronomic level, where the soil will be protected by growing a layer of indigenous plants and other, that resort to the soil’s digitization in order to improve the deployment of fertilizers. This paper addresses the latter and aims to provide an overall description of the architecture of a predictive control system based on the soil’s digital twin. In this control paradigm, an artificial intelligence layer will follow the entire cultivation process through the development of a soil’s digital twin. This model will be able to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of fertilization policies and be included within a model predictive control strategy in order to both decrease the concentration of chemicals released into the soil and promote the economic income of the farmer. In particular, this paper tackles one of the phases of this project where soil digitization must be carried out in order to feed the data to the digital twin. In particular, the description of the sensor network and the data management architecture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture digitization; Digital twins; Model predictive control; Sensor networks; Smart farming","Climate change; Cultivation; Information management; Model predictive control; Network architecture; Soils; Agriculture digitization; Digitisation; Grove soil; Model-predictive control; Olive grove; Portugal; S networks; Sensors network; Smart farming; Soils qualities; Sensor networks","","","","","","","Pienkowski M., Beaufoy G., The environmental impact of olive oil production in the European Union: Practical options for improving the environmental impact, European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism, (2002); Alcantara C., Pujadas A., Saavedra M., Management of cruciferous cover crops by mowing for soil and water conservation in southern Spain, Agric.

Acoustic signals produced by insects can be used as a source of information about their presence and behaviour. Problems encountered in observing acoustic signals produced by animals in the context of integrated pest control are supporting equipment factors that can facilitate data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings (species identification). The objective of this study is to design microcomputer-based bioacoustics monitoring system that is integrated with the cloud. In more detail, the specific objectives are (1) Designing microcomputer-based bioacoustics monitoring system as a supporter of data acquisition systems with cloud integration features, (2) Testing the performance of a bioacoustics monitoring system for field observations. Bioacoustics monitoring system based on a microcomputer with cloud integration has been developed to support the implementation of integrated pest management. The developed system uses a raspberry pi as a central processing unit in local for data acquisition systems that are connected to the cloud using the Internet connection. As a result of the laboratory-scale test in indoor and outdoor setup, the system could record sample insect sound (Katydid and Cricket) clearly for both conditions, although noise from environment also appears in data analysis affecting the insect identification in future utilization. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Acoustic waves; Audio acoustics; Audio equipment; Bioacoustics; Data acquisition; Environmental testing; Forestry; Information management; Integration testing; Microcomputers; Pest control; Program processors; Timber; Agriculture productions; Cloud integrations; Data acquisition system; Ecological approaches; Field observations; Integrated Pest Management; Internet connection; Species identification; Monitoring","","","","","Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","Authors wishing to acknowledge financial support from Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia.

As first-hand scientific research data producers, agricultural scientific research and experiment station gathers massive scientific research data of different types which are in a loosely managed state. So, the establishment of its data management standard system is not only a basis for standardized data management but also an important part of standardized data management work. And it is of great significance for improving data reusability and fully developing data value. In this research, by investigating the data characteristics and the whole life cycle management process of the agricultural scientific research and experiment station in China, we found that the data had four characteristics: 1) multi-source and isomerism; 2) Small data centralized management, big data decentralized management; 3) short time duration and poor continuity of data; 4) low data standardization and insufficient data sharing. And based on the problem of “small data centralized management, big data decentralized management”, we explored the workflow for routine data management in agricultural scientific research and experiment station, then designed a unified workflow. Under the fragmented data management workflow, it was usually a lack of professional and unified standard system in agricultural scientific research and experiment station, so the data sharing and reusability rate were very low, and the data value was hard to realize. But, based on a unified data management standard system, there were the specialized person responsible for data management and sharing and provided services for users, which effectively guaranteed the data quality, greatly improved the probability of the users to discover the data, and reduced the workload of the data owners to manage the data. Additionally, based on the “Hall three-dimensional structure”, we constructed the standard system framework for data management of agricultural scientific research and experiment station from three dimensions: standard application data management stage, standard features, and standard professional field. From the dimension of standard application data management stage, the data management standard system should focus on the life-cycle management process such as data collection, data processing, data archiving, data storage and sharing, and each data management stage should have corresponding standards as the basis and guidance. From the dimension of the standard features, the data management standard system should include technical standards, work standards, and management standards. And different types of standards complemented each other to ensure the orderly implementation of data management. From the dimension of the standard professional field, guidance standard was the foundation, data standard was the core and management standard was the guarantee. Based on the previous research and two rounds of expert review and discussion, the data management standard system table of agricultural scientific research and experiment station was compiled. It contained 20 standards covering the whole life cycle of data management of data. Among them, 12 standards were mandatory construction standards for the first construction phase. This table could be used to guide the construction of a personalized standard system for different agricultural scientific research and experiment stations, to achieve the maximum standardization effect with minimum resource input. This standard system was the basis of standardized data management of agricultural scientific research and experiment station and was of great significance to promote the construction of agricultural scientific research and experiment station. However, there is still a big challenge: how to get through the data collection channels to centralize the data (especially the long tail data) from different data producers? A complete collaboration mechanism is also needed. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Industry is pursuing these objectives by developing the concept of the “intelligent factory” (also referred to as the “smart factory”) and, by studying the similarities between industry and agriculture, we can exploit the achievements attained in industry for agriculture. This article focuses on studying those similarities regarding robotics to advance agriculture toward the concept of “intelligent farms” (smart farms). Thus, this article presents some characteristics that agricultural robots should gain from industrial robots to attain the intelligent farm concept regarding robot morphologies and features as well as communication, computing, and data management techniques. The study, restricted to robotics for outdoor farms due to the fact that robotics for greenhouse farms deserves a specific study, reviews different structures for robot manipulators and mobile robots along with the latest techniques used in intelligent factories to advance the characteristics of robotics for future intelligent farms. This article determines similarities, contrasts, and differences between industrial and field robots and identifies some techniques proven in the industry with an extraordinary potential to be used in outdoor farms such as those derived from methods based on artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, Big Data techniques, and cloud computing procedures. Moreover, different types of robots already in use in industry and services are analyzed and their advantages in agriculture reported (parallel, soft, redundant, and dual manipulators) as well as ground and aerial unmanned robots and multi-robot systems. © 2020 by the authors.

The ease in life of many people like farmers, educators, administers, managers, etc., is increased with more inventions of the researchers using this new technology. The progressive technology for data management is providing more amount of information. However, is the user able to access the needed information when required? This question rises to the more questions like, how to identify whether the information is as per the requirement? Whether a user is authorized or not? The answer for all the questions is to make the support aware of the context. Therefore, the present technology needs to be modified to make the system aware about the context. The process of demonstrating the services based on the context using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with the help of illustration on mango crop is emphasized in this paper. There are many serious problems like unsuitable fertilizer use, wrong selection of crops in wrong seasons, water waste, poor publicizing in the case of farming. These problems are addressed using the ubiquitous context aware middleware architecture for precision agriculture in mango crop. © 2022 Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

A years' worth of data (2015) was obtained from a large swine production and data management company located in Ontario, Canada. There was a total of 155 different transportation vehicles, and 220 different farms within the study population. Two-mode networks were constructed for 1-,3-, and 7-day time periods over the entire year and were analyzed. Trends in the size of the maximum weak component and outgoing contact chain over discrete time periods were investigated using linear regression. Additionally, the number of different types of facilities with betweenness >0 and in/out degree>0 were analyzed using Poisson regression. Maximum weekly outgoing contact chain (MOCCw) contained between 2.1% and 7.1% of the study population. This suggests a potential maximum of disease spread within this population if the disease was detected within one week. Frequency of node types within MOCCw showed considerable variability; although nursery sites were relatively most frequent. The regression analysis of several node and network level statistics indicated a potential peak time of connectivity during the summer months and warrants further confirmation and investigation. The inclusion of transportation vehicles contributed to the linear increase in the maximum weekly weak component (MWCw) size over time. This finding in combination with constant population dynamics, may have been driven by the differential utilization of trucks over time. Despite known limitations of maximum weak components as an estimator of possible outbreaks, this finding suggests that transportation vehicles should be included, when possible and relevant, in the evaluation of contacts between farms. © 2020 Melmer et al.

The key challenges at the heart of this problem, however, lie with robust communication, efficient data management, and effective sharing of information among the agents. To this end, here we present CCM-SLAM, a centralized collaborative SLAM framework for robotic agents, each equipped with a monocular camera, a communication unit, and a small processing board. With each agent able to run visual odometry onboard, CCM-SLAM ensures their autonomy as individuals, while a central server with potentially bigger computational capacity enables their collaboration by collecting all their experiences, merging and optimizing their maps, or disseminating information back to them, where appropriate. An in-depth analysis on benchmarking datasets addresses the scalability and the robustness of CCM-SLAM to information loss and communication delays commonly occurring during real missions. This reveals that in the worst case of communication loss, collaboration is affected, but not the autonomy of the agents. Finally, the practicality of the proposed framework is demonstrated with real flights of three small aircraft equipped with different sensors and computational capabilities onboard and a standard laptop as the server, collaboratively estimating their poses and the scene on the fly. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","aerial robotics; collaborative slam; cooperative robots; perception","Air transportation; Autonomous agents; Information dissemination; Information management; Mapping; Sensory perception; Aerial robotics; collaborative slam; Communication delays; Computational capability; Computational capacity; Cooperative robots; Robust communication; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Robotics","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF, (PP00P2157585); National Centre of Competence in Research Robotics","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF, Agreement no.

Its main focus is to calculate birth death rate, mobility, literacy ratio, and marriages. The immense population growth is presenting new challenges to handle massive quantities of demographic data (big data). With the evolution of computer age and software development, different procedures have been introduced to deal with big data. Most of the systems are based on traditional rational database, which lack in their capability to handle big data efficiently and accurately. Apache Hadoop platform is becoming famous for handling big data problems. Herein, we propose a demography big data handling system under Hadoop ecosystem to solve the issue of demography large-scale data handling. The main components of our system are Sqoop, HBase and Hive. Our system defines a method to export data from different RDBMS to Hadoop HBase. Moreover, HBase-Hive integration is a good architecture to store and query data for analysis efficiently. The results indicate that the presented approach better handles the distributed datasets as a single dataset to analyze for future estimates. Our approach will provide advancement in handling sophisticated demography big data and will eventually improve analytics such as promoting sustainable agriculture, preventing poverty, and decreasing death rate. © 2018 IEEE.","Big Data Analysis; Demography Big Data; HBase; Hive; MapReduce; RDBMS","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data handling; Information management; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Query processing; Software design; Big data management systems; HBase; Hive; Map-reduce; Massive quantities; RDBMS; Statistical measures; Sustainable agriculture; Big data","","","","","","","Apache Hadoop; Sqoop; HBase; Apache Software Foundation, (2012); Dean J., Ghemawat S., MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, Communications of the ACM, 51, 1, (2008); Jain A., Instant Apache Sqoop, (2013); Vora M.N., Hadoop-HBase for large-scale data, Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, Harbin, pp. 601-605, (2011); Thusoo A., Et al., Hive-a petabyte scale data warehouse using Hadoop, 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010), Long Beach, CA, pp. 996-1005, (2010); Aiyer A.S., Bautin M., Chen G.J., Damania P., Khemani P., Muthukkaruppan K., Ranganathan K., Spiegelberg N., Tang L., Vaidya M., Storage infrastructure behind Facebook Messages: Using HBase at scale, IEEE Data Eng.

The protection of the rural ranch is essential for the observation of agricultural products. The presentation of the current horticultural innovation made it possible to view the construction of safety switchboards for the ranch's land. Due to agricultural land or rural land, observation is essential to prevent unauthorized access to the area, as well as to protect the region from winged creatures. Safety is not yet as far as resources, in addition, horticultural articles need safety and protection at an exceptionally early stage, similar to insurance against attacks by rodents or creepy crawlers, in ranches or grain stores. These difficulties must be taken into account. Keeping this situation in our psyche, we have structured, tested and studied a device based on ""Web of Things"" which is equipped to dissect the data detected at that point and transmit them to the client. This device is regularly monitored and observed from remote areas and is frequently updated on farms, grain stores and cold stores for safety reasons.

Machine learning–based clustering algorithms are used in analyzing climate data time series from more than 3,000 climate observation sites in the United States, with the objective of classifying climate type for regions across the United States. Understanding the climate type of a region has applications in public health, environment, actuarial science, insurance, agriculture, and engineering. In this study, daily climate data measurements for temperature and precipitation from the time period 1946–2015 have been used. The daily data observations were grouped into three derived data sets: a monthly data set (daily data aggregated by month), an annual data set (daily data aggregated by year), and a threshold exceeding frequency data set (threshold exceeding frequency provides the frequency of occurrence of certain climate extremes). Three existing clustering algorithms from the literature, namely, k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies, were each applied to cluster each of the data sets, and the resulting clusters were assessed using standardized clustering indices. The results from these unsupervised learning techniques revealed the suitability and applicability of these algorithms in the climate domain. The clusters identified by these techniques were also compared with existing climate classification types such as the Köppen classification system. Additionally, the work also developed an interactive web and map-based data visualization system that uses efficient big data management techniques to provide clustering solutions in real time and to display the results of the clustering analysis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","big data; climate data; clustering; computational geosciences; machine learning","United States; algorithm; climate classification; cluster analysis; data management; data set; detection method; machine learning; precipitation (climatology); unsupervised classification","","","","","NOAA RISA, (NA13OAR4310183); NOAA Southern Regional Climate Center, (AB-133E-16-CQ-0023/T0001)","This work was funded by the NOAA Southern Regional Climate Center grant (AB-133E-16-CQ-0023/T0001) and the NOAA RISA grant (NA13OAR4310183).","Bailey R.G., Ecosystem geography: From ecoregions to sites, (2009); Bicici E., Yuret D., Locally scaled density based clustering, Adaptive and Natural Computing Algorithms.

Good decision would be obtained if the supporting data required are satisfied and using appropriate methods. This study aims to develop a Decision Support System that can be used to predict the risk level of rice production in some districts which are central of rice production in East Java. Web-based decision support system is constructed so that the information can be easily accessed and understood. Components of the system are data management, model management, and user interface. This research uses regression models of OLS and Copula. OLS model used to predict rainfall while Copula model used to predict harvested area. Experimental results show that the models used are successfully predict the harvested area of rice production in some districts which are central of rice production in East Java at any given time based on the conditions and climate of a region. Furthermore, it can predict the amount of rice production with the level of risk. System generates prediction of production risk level in the long term for some districts that can be used as a decision support for the authorities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agriculture; Climate models; Decision making; Forecasting; Information management; Regression analysis; Risk management; Risks; User interfaces; Websites; Agricultural planning; Copula models; Decision supports; Model management; Production risks; Regression model; Rice production; Web-based decision support systems; Decision support systems","","","","","Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia","We would like to thank the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia for supporting this research.","Sugumaran R., Degroote J., Spatial Decision Support Systems Principles and Practices, (2011); Rao N.H., Brownee S.M., Sarma P.B.S., GIS-Based Decision Support System for Real Time Water Demand Estimation in Canal Irrigation Systems, Current Science, 87, (2004); Mbilinyi B.P., Tumbo S.D., Mahoo H.F., Mkiramwinyi F.O., GIS-Based Decision Support System for Identifying Potential Sites for Rainwater Harvesting, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 32, 15-18, pp. 1074-1081, (2007); Sutikno, Kuswanto H., Ratih I.D., Journal of Mathematics and Statistics, 10, 2, pp. 192-200, (2014); Turban E., Aronson J.E., Decisions Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, (1998)","","Muhammad N.","Institute of Physics Publishing","","1st International Conference on Applied and Industrial Mathematics and Statistics 2017, ICoAIMS 2017","8 August 2017 through 10 August 2017","Kuantan, Pahang","130792","17426588","","","","English","J.

Large volumes of data can be efficiently handled by partitioning them into clusters followed by Indexing. An efficient clustering and indexing method is required to process continuous queries for retrieving data streams. A new index structure called adaptive clustering and block-based indexing (ACBBI) is proposed, which is a fusion of cluster-based and block-based techniques to process continuous queries. The incoming data are clustered and stored as blocks using the adaptive clustering method and further indexed by the adaptive indexing approach. Livestock market values that are time variant are used for experimentation. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the ACBBI tree structure significantly decreases half of the space cost, scales better with increasing data size and improves the retrieval rate 30% more than an existing CKDB approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Clustering; Continuous queries; Data management; Data retrieval; Data stream; Indexing; Query processing","Agriculture; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Information management; Query processing; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Adaptive clustering; Adaptive indexing; Clustering; Continuous queries; Data retrieval; Data stream; Experimental analysis; Stock market analysis; Data handling","","","","","","","Amini A., Wah T.Y., Saboohi H., On density-based data streams clustering algorithms: A survey, J.

Accurately and rapidly acquiring phenotype of plants or cells in different environments can accelerate the efficiency of understanding the response of crops to environmental factors, which can provide theoretical and technical support for accelerating the development of crop science and prompting the sustainable development of agriculture in China. Traditional method for the determination of crop parameters is based on field sampling and mechanized high-throughput platform, which is time-consuming, and has low efficiency and incomplete spatial coverage. The development of crop science is limited by the quick and accurate acquisition of field-based phenotyping. Proximal remote sensing phenotyping platform represented by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be timely, rapid, noninvasive and efficient access to crop phenotypes, which makes it become an important means to obtain crop phenotypic information and a powerful tool to study the phenotypes. According to the latest research achievements of UAV-RSP (remote sensing platform) in analyzing the crop phenotype, the review described the advantage and disadvantage of the application of UAV-RSP with different types of sensors to field-based phenotyping, summed up the methods for quantitative remote sensing inversion of crop phenotypic information, and prospected the application of UAV-RSP to field-based phenotyping. UAV-RSP has the advantages of flexible motor, being suitable for complex field environment, timely data acquisition, high efficiency and low cost, which can be used to rapid and cost-effective phenotype judge for a large number of plots and field trials of massive germplasm. The vehicles with flying capacity without manned control have several types, ranging from multicopters and helicopters to fixed wing. The most frequently used sensors in UAV-RSP include digital camera, multispectral sensor, hyperspectral sensor, thermal imager and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems. The UAV-RSP have been used for acquiring crop traits including morphological parameters, spectrum and texture characteristics, physiological traits, and response to abiotic/biotic stress under different environments. However, the field-based phenotyping by UAV-RSP usually focuses on wheat, maize, rice and sorghum, and there are more crops that need to be investigated. And the crop phenotyping by remote sensing lacks the fusion of multi-source data. Strategies for high-throughput field-based phenotyping were investigated with different methods, which showed obvious difference of estimation accuracy. The accuracy of retrieval model for estimating field-based phenotyping depends on the climate, crops and their growth stages. Methods such as machine learning, spectral retrieval, analysis of canopy temperature and comprehensive evaluation have been widely used for field-based phenotyping by researchers. However, there exist some problems that restrict the application of UAV-based crop phenotyping. The shortcomings include the imperfection of agricultural aviation regulations, the deficiencies of phenotyping for massive germplasm, the lack of method for fast hyperspectral and LiDAR data management, the high price of sensors and the uncertainty of remote sensing retrieval model. The developments of UAV-based phenotyping are as follows: the combination of crop breeding and UAV remote sensing, the efficient data processing, the well-informed analysis of multi-source data, and the development of low-cost sensor. The results of this study have important significance for promoting the application of UAV-RSP and speeding up the development of crop science. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, there are still few studies dedicated to estimate soil moisture for long lead times, which reflects the difficulties associated with this topic. An approach that could help improving these forecasts performance is to use ensemble predictions. In this study, a soil moisture forecast for lead times of one, three and six months in the Ijuí River Basin (Brazil) was developed using ensemble precipitation forecasts and hydrologic simulation. All ensemble members from three climatologic models were used to run the MGB hydrological model, generating 207 soil moisture forecasts, organized in groups: (A) for each model, the most frequent soil moisture interval predicted among the forecasts made with each ensemble member, (B) using each model’s mean precipitation, (C) considering a super-ensemble, and (D) the mean soil moisture interval predicted among group B forecasts. The results show that long-term soil moisture based on precipitation forecasts can be useful for identifying periods drier or wetter than the average for the studied region. Nevertheless, estimation of exact soil moisture values remains limited. Forecasts groups B and D performed similarly to groups A and C, and require less data management and computing time. © 2020, Brazilian Journal of Water Resources.

In their natural state, streams and their associated floodplains provide a variety of important functions including the movement of water and sediment, storage of flood waters, recharge of groundwater, treatment of pollutants, dynamic stability, and habitat diversity. Disturbances to this system, either natural or human-induced, places stress on the system and has the potential to alter structure and/or impair the ability of the stream to perform ecological functions. Water conservation structures are helpful in maintaining the desired flow requirement and sediment yield within the watershed area. In this study, Jonk River, a tributary of Mahanadi basin has been selected to assess the impact of conservation structures for disaster risk reduction, sustainable agriculture and rural development. The outlet of Jonk River is located near Rampur in Chhattisgarh. Total area of the watershed is computed as 3424 km2. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used to calculate the discharge and sediment flow on daily and monthly basis for the year of 2001 considering two case scenarios i.e. with and without ponds as conservation structure (20 ponds in the villages are considered along the buffer area of the centreline of jonk river). The simulated discharge and sediment flow data has been compared with the observed data and the correlation coefficient is found to be 0.84 & 0.77 respectively. The annual discharge and sediment flow value in “with pond scenario” has been detected to be reduced by 69.27 and 64.10% respectively. The results observed in the present work can be used for site suitability analysis of soil and water conservation structures in the areas those are prone to soil erosion and floods. The study also reveals that the applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Geospatial Data Management can be used efficiently for watershed management and rural development. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Discharge; Geoinformatics; Sediment flow; SWAT; Watershed","Agriculture; Digital storage; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Floods; Groundwater pollution; Information management; Lakes; Recharging (underground waters); Regional planning; Risk assessment; Rivers; Sediments; Soil conservation; Soils; Water conservation; Water treatment; Watersheds; Correlation coefficient; Disaster risk reductions; Ecological functions; Geo-informatics; Simulated discharges; Soil and water assessment tool; Sustainable agriculture; SWAT; Rural areas","","","","","","","Bhuyan S.J., Koelliker J.K., Marzen L.J., Harrington J.R., An integrated approach for water quality assessment of Kansas watershed, Environ.

Data-driven approaches do lead to new possibilities, and significant improvements within a broad range of domains can be achieved through a cloud-based infrastructure. In the agricultural sector, data-driven precision agriculture shows great potential in facilitating the increase in food production demanded by the increasing world population. However, the adoption rate of precision agriculture technology has been slow, and information and communications technology needed to promote the implementation of precision agriculture is limited by proprietary integrations and non-standardized data formats and connections. In this paper, an open geospatial data infrastructure is presented, based on standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The emphasis in the design was on improved interoperability, with the capability of using sensors, performing cloud processing, carrying out regional statistics, and provide seamless connectivity to machine terminals. The infrastructure was implemented through open source software, and was complemented by open data from governmental offices along with ESA satellite imagery. Four use cases are presented, covering analysis of nearly 50 000 crop fields and providing seamless interaction with an emulated machine terminal. They act to showcase both for how the infrastructure enables modularity and interoperability, and for the new possibilities which arise from this new approach to data within the agricultural domain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Farm management information systems; Internet of Things; Open data; Open software; Remote sensing","Agricultural technology; Big data; Information management; Interoperability; Open source software; Population statistics; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Agricultural sector; Cloud-based; Data-driven approach; Farm management; Farm management information system; Geospatial infrastructure; Open datum; Open software; Precision Agriculture; Remote-sensing; agricultural management; agricultural research; agricultural technology; analytical method; data management; data processing; data set; field; food production; government; information and communication technology; infrastructure; interdisciplinary approach; Internet; interpolation; precision agriculture; remote sensing; research work; sensor; software; Internet of things","","","","","Innovationsfonden","This work was funded by Innovation Fund Denmark as part of the Future Cropping project (J. nr. 5107-00002B).

However, previous studies pointed out a low level of SFTs adoption, often highlighting that technologies and innovations successfully adopted may be rejected by the users, who go back to the traditional practices even where benefits were being enjoyed. This study aimed at investigating the role played by individual variables, farming system characteristics, and perceived barriers in affecting the adoption of SFTs in a sample of Italian farm operators. Three-hundred and ten participants were administered a paper-and-pencil questionnaire addressing perceived economic, market and data management barriers in the adoption of SFTs. At the same time a set of user and farm-related variables was collected. The analyses showed that farm size and the perception of economic barriers affected the adoption of SFTs. Larger farms were more likely to adopt the SFTs investigated. The present results pointed out some critical aspects which may benefit from tailor-made interventions in terms of policies, work re-organization and/or operators’ training, to support and widen the use of SFTs in the Italian context. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Barrier to innovation; Innovation adoption; Italy; Smart farming; Survey","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Information management; Agricultural productions; Economic barriers; Farm size; Farming system; Related variables; Resource-efficient; Personnel training","","","","","","","Adrian A.M., Norwood S.H., Mask P.L., Producers’ perceptions and attitudes toward precision agriculture technologies, Computer and Electronics in Agriculture, 48, 3, pp. 256-271, (2005); Caffaro F., Roccato M., Micheletti Cremasco M., Cavallo E., Part-time farmers and accidents with agricultural machinery: A moderated mediated model on the role played by frequency of use and unsafe beliefs, Journal of Occupational Health, 60, 1, pp. 80-84, (2018); Cavallo E., Ferrari E., Bollani L., Coccia M., Attitudes and behaviour of adopters of technological innovations in agricultural tractors: A case study in Italian agricultural system, Agricultural Systems, 130, pp. 44-54, (2014); Cullen R., Forbes S.L., Grout R., Non-adoption of environmental innovations in wine growing, New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science, 41, 1, pp. 41-48, (2013); Daberkow S.G., McBride W.D., Farm and operator characteristics affecting the awareness and adoption of precision agriculture technologies in the US, Precision Agriculture, 4, 2, pp. 163-177, (2003); Precision Agriculture and the Future of Farming in Europe.

The performance for these organizations is directly dependent on the efficiency of data access, data processing, and data management. Data is storing in one environment that is called database. One database should be able to cover all the organizations database needs. Storing, indexing, filtering and returning data on real-time, are four very important issues that affect directly at high performance. But, how to get these features in one database? You can optimize data by using MongoDb combined with Elasticsearch. MongoDb is a NOSQL database for storing big data and returning data on real-time. ElasticSearch is the best for indexing and filtering data. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate combination of using MongoDb with Elasticsearch for optimize data and how to evaluate their performance according to the typical use for storing and retrieving data.

Rainfall, in particular, contributes to a majority of problems associated with agriculture, be it more rain leading to crop destruction or less rain contributing to the lack of water. In this paper, we present a technique which will definitively free plants and crops from any sort of water peril.

The system takes SK-S7G2 microcontroller as the core to build a bidirectional data channel between the client and temperature sensor, humidity sensor and light intensity sensor by using 4-G wireless network and Ethernet communication modes. Then, the sensor parameters are sent to the client and the control instructions of the client are received to realize the remote real-time control of the motor, fan and other equipment. the production environment data collected by SK-S7G2 are transferred into the database of cloud server to construct an agricultural database of real parameters of crop growth environment. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the management system have been verified by the real environmental test, which proves that the design of the management system proposed in this paper is an effective solution of the intelligent agricultural water and fertilizer irrigation system with the characteristics of energy saving, high efficiency, accuracy and scalability. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Internet of Things; SK-S7G2; Water and fertilizer integration","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Energy conservation; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Environmental testing; Fertilizers; Information management; Real time control; Remote control; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural water; Control instruction; Effective solution; Ethernet communications; Integrated management systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Irrigation systems; Production environments; Internet of things","","","","","","","Chen Y., Liu Y., Li Y., Agricultural development and industrial prosperity under the background of rural revitalization in China, Geogr.

The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the “next generation” models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimensions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can help guide the design and development of next generation of agricultural system tools and methods. A number of past events combined with overall technological progress in other fields have strongly contributed to the evolution of agricultural system modeling, including development of process-based bio-physical models of crops and livestock, statistical models based on historical observations, and economic optimization and simulation models at household and regional to global scales. Characteristics of agricultural systems models have varied widely depending on the systems involved, their scales, and the wide range of purposes that motivated their development and use by researchers in different disciplines. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across disciplines, and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage is set for the major advances in agricultural systems science that are needed for the next generation of models, databases, knowledge products and decision support systems. The lessons from history should be considered to help avoid roadblocks and pitfalls as the community develops this next generation of agricultural systems models. © 2016 The Authors","Agricultural systems; Data; History; Models; Next generation","agricultural history; agricultural modeling; data management; decision making; decision support system; design; farming system; knowledge; optimization; technological development","","","","","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/M021386/1)","","Acock B., Reddy V.R., Whisler E.D., Baker D.N., Hodges H.F., Boote K.J., The soybean crop simulator GLYCIM.

In some applications, sensors can be deployed in remote, large unpopulated areas, whereas in others, they serve to monitor confined busy spaces. In either case, clustering the sensor network's nodes into several clusters is of fundamental benefit for obvious scalability reasons, and also for helping to devise maintenance or usage schedules that might greatly improve the network's lifetime. In the present paper, we survey and compare popular and advanced clustering schemes and provide a detailed analysis of their performance as a function of scale, type of collected data or their heterogeneity, and noise level. The testing is performed on real sensor data provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, using various external validation metrics. © 2019 by the authors.","Clustering evaluation; clustering techniques; Internet of Things","","","","","","","","Farhat A., Guyeux C., Makhoul A., Jaber A., Tawil R., On the coverage effects in wireless sensor networks based prognostic and health management, Int.

Farmers and agro specialists can use their smartphones and tablets to easily communicate, advertise goods and services, as well as access agronomic data in soft-real time. The palpable barrier however is the mode of communication of these mobile devices, which is the use of wireless channels orthodoxly. As a result, agronomic mobile applications can experience bandwidth fluctuations and inefficient propagation of data in mobile cloud computing architectures. To address this issue, some existing works proposed a P2P synchronisation technique that is based on three algorithms namely: Bloom filters, whole state data transfer, and exchange of deltas only. In this paper, we have totally redesigned and replaced the P2P synchronisations with the data-centric publish-subscribe model that improves the efficiency of the agronomic data synchronisation. As part of this research, a real-world agronomic mobile app is developed and tested where empirical evaluations show that the data-centric publish-subscribe approach is better in terms of latency optimisation in agronomic data management. The well-researched app is called FlagThis and it is available in the App store for free download by farmers and agro-experts. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Agro-data; Cloud computing; Middleware; Mobile devices; P2P; Publish-subscribe; Synchronisation","","","","","","","","Baldoni R., Virgillito A., Distributed Event Routing in Publish/Subscribe Communication Systems: A Survey, (2006); Bloom B.H., Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors, Communications of the ACM, 13, 7, pp. 422-426, (1970); Christensen K., Roginsky A., Jimeno M., A new analysis of the false positive rate of a bloom filter, Information Processing Letters, 110, 21, pp. 944-949, (2010); Chuchra J., The Cloud Goes Green, (2015); Cugola G., Di Nitto E., Fuggetta A., The JEDI event-based infrastructure and its application to the development of the OPSS WFMS, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 27, 9, pp. 827-850, (2001); Da Rocha R.C.A., Endler M., De Siqueira T.S., Middleware for ubiquitous context-awareness, PAC '08 Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Middleware for Pervasive and Ad-Hoc Computing, (2008); Eppstein D., Goodrich M.T., Uyeda F., Varghese G., What's the difference?: Efficient set reconciliation without prior context, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 41, 4, pp. 218-229, (2011); Eugster T.P., Felber P.A., Guerraoui R., Kermarrec A., The many faces of publish/subscribe, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 35, 2, pp. 114-131, (2003); Flores H., Srirama S.N., Paniagua C., A generic middleware framework for handling process intensive hybrid cloud services from mobiles, Proc. of the 9th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multimedia (MoMM'11), pp. 87-94, (2011); Heimbigne D., Extending the Siena Publish/Subscribe System, (2003); Hori M., Kawashima E., Yamazaki T., Application of cloud computing to agriculture and prospects in other fields, Fujitsu Sci.

It is a complex data-intensive process and requires the animal breeder to maintain 7–10 forms having 230 data fields. Each data field may have 5–100 options to be filled in, which is a challenging task to be done on a small screen mobile phone by low-literate breeder. We followed an iterative design process to improve the overall user experience. We interacted with the end users, understood their environment, and analyzed the existing methods. We analyzed all the forms and data recorded by them in last 3 years. We analyzed major parameters like cattle species, pregnancy stages, cattle locations, etc., and based on the unique combination of these values, we defined various “contexts”. For every context and data field, we identified “context-sensitive” vocabulary (word library) extracted from the available records. So, for the selected data field, we recommended the values based on the context, from the vocabulary. During further iterations, the user choices were also learnt, and values substituted by the users, if any, against the recommendation, were added to the vocabulary. We added autocomplete suggestion feature to make it more user-friendly. We used the word usage count to rank the suggested words with the words used maximum ordered first in the recommendation. This design approach minimizes the user data entry efforts, improves the speed, and reduces error, especially by the low-literate animal breeders who are not quite comfortable with text typing on smaller screens. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Autocomplete; Breed improvement; Context sensitive; Data management; Design; Livestock artificial insemination; Rural mobile app","Agriculture; Animals; Information management; Iterative methods; Artificial insemination; Autocomplete; Breed improvement; Context sensitive; Mobile app; Design","","","","","","","Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) and Times Internet Limited, A Study of Smartphone Users in India, (2016); Medhi I., Toyama K., User Interfaces for Non-Literate and Semi-Literate Users, (2016); Summers K., Langford J., Jennifer W., Abela C., Souza R., Designing web-based forms for users with lower literacy skills, Proc.

Aiming at collecting yield data by the grain yield measurement and control system in harvest field and transmitting the collected data to the yield server in real time, and meanwhile meeting the demands of data access to all kinds of terminals, a data collection and service platform for monitoring grain yield was developed. It is helpful to achieve data real-time interacting among the on-site yield monitoring system, the mobile terminals and the remote yield server. Socket and SOAP (simple object access protocol) technologies are used to implement data exchanging between the remote server and various heterogeneous platforms. A grain yield data collecting system was developed and embedded in the IPC (industrial personal computer) mounted on the combine harvester to collect yield data in real time, and its modules included device setting, data collecting, data parsing and data uploading. The yield data are composed of the information input by user (farm and plot identification, which are input once for each plot), the global position system (GPS) data (longitude, latitude, altitude and time), the data (harvester speed, harvester cutter width, impulse voltage, grain moisture and grain temperature) from the sensors mounted in the harvester and the CAN (controller area network) bus. The collected yield data are packaged every 1 second and transferred to the yield server through Socket via GPRS (general packet radio service), and then they are parsed according to the yield data exchanging protocol and stored into the yield database established in the server. Then the yield data can be calculated, processed and visualized according to various modules embedded in the yield data collection and service system which is developed using Hadoop and Web GIS (web geographic information system) technologies. And the modules include user management, news management, bulletin management, document management, farm management, plot management, yield data management, harvester tracing and Web GIS service, and the grain yield data collecting system is connected with the remote data access terminals through the data collection module and data service module which are embedded in the yield data management. Yield data service is implemented using Web Service based on SOAP for data sharing for various terminals (such as mobile, tablet PC (personal computer), PDA (personal digital assistant), and desktop) with different operating systems (such as Windows, Macintosh, Linux or Android). A grain yield querying system was established for testing the yield data service XML (extensive makeup language) interface provided by the yield data collection and service system, the information including farm, plot and yield could be accessed smoothly, and the yield data visualization could be achieved accordingly. For improving the yield data transmission efficiency, GZIP (GNUzip) is used to compress SOAP messages and reduce bandwidth consumption. In addition, the digital signatures and encryption technology are used to guarantee the security of data transmission via internet. The system experiments were carried out, and the results showed that the grain yield data collecting system worked well on-site and the yield data could be collected and uploaded every 1 minute; the data collection and service system could receive, calculate, process and visualize the real-time yield data efficiently; and the Web Service interface could push the yield data querying results quickly according to client requests. The study indicates that the yield data interaction and sharing between heterogeneous platforms can be achieved by using the yield data collection and service platform proposed in this paper. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Driven by open government (2009) and big data (2012) initiatives, federal agencies have a serious need to implement intelligent data management methods, share their data, and deploy advanced analytics to their processes. Using federal data for reactive decision making is not sufficient anymore, intelligent data systems allow for proactive activities that lead to benefits such as: improved citizen services, higher accountability, reduced delivery inefficiencies, lower costs, enhanced national insights, and better policy making. No other government-dedicated work has been found in literature that addresses this broad topic. This book provides multiple use-cases, describes federal data science benefits, and fills the gap in this critical and timely area. Written and reviewed by academics, industry experts, and federal analysts, the problems and challenges of developing data systems for government agencies is presented by actual developers, designers, and users of those systems, providing a unique and valuable real-world perspective. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the growth status investigation is a routine work of cotton production in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the work from the end of April to the end of August lasts for 4 months every year. However, the current work is usually a manual survey, the data are recorded on paper, and the investigation process is very time-consuming and the data cannot be easily analyzed, which seriously affect the work efficiency. In the background, we developed the cotton growth status investigation system based on smartphone. The system includes 2 parts: mobile-side and server-side, for 4 kinds of users: agricultural technicians, agronomists, agricultural production managers and system administrators. The agricultural technicians use mobile terminal system in the cotton field to collect both text and picture data which are sent to the server system, while they receive production instructions. The server system is constructed by the REST (representational state transfer) architecture to provide the data management and analysis service interface for the mobile terminal system, and to deploy functional modules such as data processing, production instruction management and system management. Agronomists use the system to get the current cotton growth status and pest information and publish production guidance. The agricultural production managers use the system to allocate investigative tasks, check the implementation of the investigation, publish relevant cultivation or plant protection measures, and give farmers assistance and guidance. The system administrator is responsible for the management of the system's basic data (such as farmland, users and other basic information) to ensure the normal operation of the system. According to user requirements, the system can collect 6 kinds of data: cotton growth status, cotton spider mite, cotton aphid, adult cotton bollworm, cotton bollworm larvae and cotton bollworm eggs. In this article, we concisely introduced the advantages and practical feasibilities of cotton growth investigation by smartphone, and the design and implement methods of the investigation system are introduced based on android platform. We analyzed the main functions of server-side, and introduced the system design and development based on.net platform. We also presented the investigation criteria and methods for the 6 kinds of data. The system has been used in the 105th Group of the 6th Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for 3 years, and the application experience showed that cotton production information could be quickly collected by the investigation system, and all of the data could be easily analyzed and displayed by field map and statistical analysis charts. The system can be easily extended to other areas of data surveys, such as forestry and animal husbandry. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

At present, the phenomenon of information alone between various IOT data application systems makes it difficult to realize IOT sensor data sharing. However, with the developing of agricultural whole industry chain information management and forest ecological monitoring domain, the demand for each link of IOT sensor data of agriculture and forestry are getting stronger. In order to overcome the problem, a sharing platform for distributed multi-source IOT sensor data of agriculture and forestry was designed. The platform was divided into 5 parts, including data center subsystem, data adapter subsystem, data storage subsystem, data publishing subsystem and data transmission bus. The data center subsystem was responsible for managing the basic information of the sensor, and realized basic information storage function and registration function of the sensor nodes. This subsystem was the core of the platform for data management, which provided basic information of the sensor nodes for other subsystems. The data adapter subsystem was responsible for receiving and analyzing data from different sensor nodes, and it used a non-blocking Socket interface and a data acquisition interface based on Http and WebService protocol to receive data from different data sources. In this subsystem, the adapter was designed according to the difference format of the received data, and the final data to be analyzed were sent to the data storage subsystem. The data storage subsystem was responsible for storing sensor nodes data using MySQL database. The data publishing subsystem provided standardized data query interfaces of sensor nodes, which included a single sensor node real-time data and historical data query interface, multi sensor nodes real-time data and historical data query interface. The data transmission bus was realized by Active MQ server software, and concurrent capability and response speed of the platform were tested, Concurrent capability test results showed that, error rate was 0 and data throughput was 2 724 KB when the data concurrent access link number was below level 102, which could meet the requirements of concurrent. Response speed test results of the platform showed that, response time of single sensor real-time data query was 63 ms, response time of less than 100 sensors real-time data query was 90.40 ms, average response time of historical data query was 1 846.72 ms when data were less than 1 000, and average response time of historical data query was 3 353.86 ms when data were more than 10 000, which met design requirements. The sharing platform has been deployed in laboratory of National Engineering Research Center for Information Technology in Agriculture, and the performance has been well since began to run. Currently, 550 sensor nodes' data of Shunyi, Xinjiang, Yangling, Tongzhou and other 17 units have been accessed, with the amount of accessing data more than 10 000 every day. The platform sets up a data bridge between different IOT sensor devices and the data application system in agriculture and forestry field, and realizes the unification management of the agricultural and forestry IOT sensor data. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The present study developed two artificial intelligence models for daily ET0 estimation only with temperature data, including extreme learning machine (ELM) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) in 6 meteorological stations of Sichuan basin, southwest China, and compared the proposed ELM and GRNN with the corresponding temperature-based Hargreaves (HG) model and its calibrated version considering FAO-56 Penman-Monteith ET0 as benchmark. Two data management scenarios were evaluated for estimation of ET0: (1) the models were trained/calibrated and tested using the local data of each station; and (2) the models were trained/calibrated using the pooled data from all the stations and tested in each station. In the first scenario, the results showed that the temperature-based ELM model provided the better estimation than the GRNN, HG and calibrated HG models, with average relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 0.198, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.267 mm/d and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) of 0.891, respectively. In the second scenario, GRNN model provided the most accurate results among the considered models, with average RRMSE of 0.194, MAE of 0.263 mm/d and NS of 0.895, respectively. Both of the temperature-based GRNN and ELM performed much better than the HG and calibrated HG models for the two scenarios, and the temperature-based GRNN and ELM models are appropriate alternatives for accurate estimation of ET0 for Sichuan basin of southwest China, which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system operators to improve their irrigation scheduling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme learning machine; Generalized regression neural network; Hargreaves model; Reference evapotranspiration; Temperature data","China; Sichuan Basin; Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Calibration; Evapotranspiration; Information management; Irrigation; Knowledge acquisition; Mean square error; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Water management; Extreme learning machine; Generalized regression neural networks; Hargreaves; Reference evapotranspiration; Temperature data; agricultural technology; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; data management; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; machine learning; numerical model; regression analysis; Learning systems","","","","","","","Abdullah S.S.A., Malek M.A., Abdullah N.S., Kisi O., Yap K.S., Extreme learning machines: a new approach for prediction of reference evapotranspiration, J.

The adoption of livestock technology is extremely important to enhance the quality and quantity of livestock products. Besides, technology may help farmers to increase their profit and protect the health of costumer and environment. Advanced technologies in smart farming were widely applied by livestock farmers such as data management, Internet of Things technology, precision farming, agriculture drones, and so forth. Those technologies may make a great livestock system like closed livestock production from breeding to processing and consumption. Moreover, when using smart farming techniques, farmers can better monitor or observe the need for individual animals and adjust their nutrition correspondingly, thereby preventing diseases and improving herb health. There are many benefits from adopting smart farming and also have some obstacles that farmers have to face when they would like to access to smart farming. This paper also gives extensions and innovations for small farmers that can be utilized to facilitate the processing of smart farming implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Farmers; internet of things; livestock technology; smart farming","Agricultural robots; Animals; Food technology; Information management; Internet of things; Advanced technology; Farmers; Industrial production; Internet of things technologies; Livestock production; Livestock systems; Precision farming; smart farming; Agriculture","","","","","","","Wolfert S., Ge L., Verdouw C., Bogaardt M.J., Big data in smart farming - A review, Agric.

Remote sensing, as one of the sources for big data, is generating earth-observation data and analysis results daily from the platforms of satellites, manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based structures. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for precision agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. The key of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data and geographic information, to produce spatially-varied data for subsequent precision agricultural operations. Agricultural remote sensing data, as general remote sensing data, have all characteristics of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis and visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to the success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available remote sensing data resources, recent development of technologies for remote sensing big data management, and remote sensing data processing and management for precision agriculture. A five-layer-fifteen-level (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure is described and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level (FLTL) remote sensing data management structure for management and applications of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where the sensors are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based structures. The FLTL structure is the management and application framework of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture and local farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale. © 2018 CAAS.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises. © 2019 IEEE.","","Agriculture; Artificial life; Information management; Investments; Life cycle; Supply chains; Advanced technology; Controlled environment; Farm production; Internet of thing (IOT); Large-scale applications; Livestock breeding; Management issues; Whole life cycles; Internet of things","","","","","China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund Project, (16YJC630102); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat, (CARS-07-F-1); Natural Sci ence Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province, (2016JQ7005); Polytech nic University, (G-UADM); Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone, (2016RKX-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71503199, 71531002, 71703122); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2018RWSK02)","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 71703122, 71531002 and 71503199, the National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat under Grant CARS-07-F-1, China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund Project under Grant 16YJC630102, the Natural Science Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province under Grant 2016JQ7005, Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone under Grant 2016RKX-04, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2018RWSK02, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Internal Project under Grant G-UADM.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by National Natural Sci ence Foundation of China under Grants 71703122, 71531002 and 71503199, the National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat under Grant CARS-07-F-1, China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund Project under Grant 16YJC630102, the Natural Sci ence Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province under Grant 2016JQ7005, Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone under Grant 2016RKX-04, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2018RWSK02, and The Hong Kong Polytech nic University Internal Project under Grant G-UADM.","Global Agriculture Towards 2050, (2009); Zhang W.F., Et al., Closing yield gaps in China by empowering smallholder farmers, Nature, 537, pp. 671-674, (2016); Maurya S., Jain V.K., Energy-efficient network protocol for precision agriculture, IEEE Consum.

While social surveys capture the socioeconomic features, the information was inadequately integrated with the biophysical features of an ALS and the applications are limited due to the issues of cost and efficiency to carry out such detailed and comparable social surveys at a large spatial coverage. In this paper, we introduce a smartphone-based app, called eFarm: a crowdsourcing and human sensing tool to collect the geotagged ALS information at the land parcel level, based on the high resolution remotely-sensed images. We illustrate its main functionalities, including map visualization, data management, and data sensing. Results of the trial test suggest the system works well. We believe the tool is able to acquire the human–land integrated information which is broadly-covered and timely-updated, thus presenting great potential for improving sensing, mapping, and modeling of ALS studies. © 2017 by the authors.

Such an uncontrolled process poses questions on sustainability of the virtual environment (i.e. a software-based space) where such processes take place. The aim of the present work is to introduce a digitization footprint (DF), which parameterizes the amount of digital information so as to quantify the specific or general use of digital or processing information in terms of volumes, time, efforts or costs invested for data storage, processing or transfer. Such a digitization footprint can be directly related to the availability and suitability of the digital resources in terms of costs (storage, transfer, processing, cloud computing), and speed (processing, upload, download), and can help define pathways for effective and widespread development. © Wageningen Academic Publishers 2019","Big data; Data management; Digitization; Virtual environment","Analog to digital conversion; Big data; Data handling; Digital storage; Information management; Information use; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Virtual reality; Communication infrastructure; Data storage; Digital information; Digital resources; Geolocation systems; Monitoring stations; Remote sensing technology; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Amatya S., Karkee M., Zhang Q., Whiting M.D., Automated detection of branch shaking locations for robotic cherry harvesting using machine vision, Robotics, 6, (2017); Bramley R.G.V., Proffitt A.P.B., Hinze C.J., Pearse B., Hamilton R.P., Generating benefits from precision viticulture through selective harvesting,  European Conference on Precision Agriculture, pp. 891-898, (2005); Fountas S., Carli G., Sorensen C.G., Tsiropoulos Z., Cavalaris C., Vatsanidou A., Et al., Farm management information systems: Current situation and future perspectives, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 115, pp. 40-50, (2015); Goodland R., Daly H., Environmental sustainability: Universal and non-negotiable, Ecological Applications, 6, pp. 1002-1017, (1996); Measuring the Information Society Report 2016, (2016); Kamilaris A., Kartakoullis A., Prenafeta-Boldu F.X., A review on the practice of big data analysis in agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 143, pp. 23-37, (2018); Lamb D.W., Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture: A Review of on-Farm Telecommunications Challenges and Opportunities in Supporting a Digital Agriculture Future for Australia, (2017); Le Flecher E., Durand-Petiteville A., Cadenat V., Sentenac T., Vougioukas S., Implementation on a harvesting robot of a sensor-based controller performing a u-turn, Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Workshop of Electronics, Control, Measurement, Signals and Their Application to Mechatronics, (2017); McBratney A.B., Whelan B., Ancev T., Bouma J., Future directions of precision agriculture, Precision Agriculture, 6, pp. 7-23, (2005); Miller N.J., Griffin T.W., Bergtold J., Ciampitti I.A., Sharda A., Farmers' adoption path of precision agriculture technology,  European Conference on Precision Agriculture.

The relevance of this season consists in great air variations due to the transition from winter to summer. Being monitored in a vine area near Bucharest, these data may be useful for different statistics related to grapes culture in this season and can be used by interested parties for future predictions related to vine crops. Moreover, in this paper, data fusion will allow advanced data management and coherence achievement among collected data. © The Author(s), 2020.","Precision Agriculture Data Fusion Reliability Sensors","","","","","","","","Marcu I., Suciu G., Balaceanu C., Dragulinescu A.-M., Dobrea M.

Multi-source, multi-scale, multi-temporal agricultural remote sensing and monitoring provides data with huge volume and high complexity for various analytical applications for effective precision agricultural operations. In the past decade, precision agricultural research have been conducted with the images acquired in the research farms over an area of 400 ha in the center of the Mississippi Delta. The images were acquired from high-resolution satellites, an agricultural airplane, and unmanned aerial vehicles along with ground-based detection and measurement. The image sensors are red-green-blue color, visible-near infrared (VNIR) multispectral, VNIR hyperspectral, and thermal infrared. The image data are not only valuable in research for precision agriculture, weed science, and crop genetics but also able to provide guides for farm consultants and producers in their digital agriculture practices in this area. The purpose of this project is to design and develop a systematic prototype to manage and publish the remote sensing image data acquired from different sources at different spatial and temporal scales on internet and mobile platforms to provide services to the local, regional, national, and even global professionals and farmers. To accommodate all data products, the images have to be resampled to fit into a global image tile structure with a data cube by stacking the image tiles in time sequences covering the same area on the ground. The application of a global image tile structure allows the local data tied into a global remote sensing big data management framework. © 2018 SPIE.","data service; precision agriculture; Remote sensing big data","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Big data; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Image acquisition; Information management; Infrared devices; Precision agriculture; Agricultural operations; Agricultural remote sensing; Analytical applications; Data services; High resolution satellites; Infrastructural development; Remote sensing images; Spatial and temporal scale; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Moran M.S., Inoue Y., Barnes E.M., Opportunities and limitations for image-based remote sensing in precision crop management, Remote Sensing of Environment, 61, pp. 319-346, (1997); Huang Y., Thomson S.J., Remote sensing for cotton farming, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Society of America, Inc., 57, pp. 1-26, (2015); Huang Y., Reddy K.N., Fletcher R.S., Pennington D., UAV low-altitude remote sensing for precision weed management, Weed Technology, 32, pp. 2-6, (2018); Huang Y., Chen Z., Yu T., Huang X., Gu X., Agricultural remote sensing big data: Processing and applications, Journal of Integrative Agriculture, 17, 9, pp. 1915-1931, (2018); Snipes C.E., Nichols S.P., Poston D.H., Walker T.W., Evans L.P., Robinson H.R., Current agricultural practices of the Mississippi Delta, Mississippi Agricultural & Forestry Experiment Station, Bulletin, 1143, (2005); Sui R., Irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensors, Journal of Agricultural Science, 10, 1, pp. 1-11, (2017)","","Wang J.; Suzuki M.; Larar A.M.","SPIE","Ministry of Earth Sciences; NASA-National Aeronautics and Space Administration; RADI-Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Remote Sensing Technology, Techniques and Applications VII 2018","24 September 2018 through 26 September 2018","Honolulu","142803","0277786X","978-151062135-0","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058244705"

Such huge amount of unstructured as well as semi-structured data coming from various sources and in different formats is termed as 'Big Data'. The trillion sensor world is further going to add to the explosive growth of Big Data segment. According to Gartner, 'Big data is high volume, high velocity, and high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight, discovery, and process optimization'. It is quite evident that Big Data is creating opportunities for effective decision making across several domains and organizations. Since many years of data management, Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have always been a comprehensive solution for storage, processing and analysis of data. But to capture, store, process, analyze and visualize Big Data, the traditional database management techniques are no longer sufficient. Here comes the question what are the limitations of traditional database systems leading to their inability to handle 'big data'? These limitations have been discussed in this chapter which made it essential to shift towards the paradigm of breakthrough big data technologies and techniques in a world drowning in a 'data tsunami'. This chapter attempts to elaborate the reasons of this paradigm shift from traditional database processing to big data processing technologies. Various big data analysis, processing and visualization techniques and technologies have been discussed in this chapter, which have changed the world of big data. Initially, large firms like Google developed technologies like MapReduce, The Google File System, Big Table etc to meet their own data needs. But eventually most of the organizations and even governments started gearing up for big data solutions to improve their decision making process by value generation based on data trends. Therefore there has been a sharp rise in the development of big data techniques. This chapter covers major breakthrough technologies like MapReduce, HadoopDB, Cassandra, Chubby Lock service, PLATFORA, SkyTree, Dremel, Pregel, Spanner, Shark, Megastore, Spark, F1, MLBase, NoSQL Databases, HBase, HDFS, YARN, Mahout and Chukwa. Big data technologies find applications in various domains like IT, Government, Defence, Manufacturing, Earth sciences, Healthcare, Agriculture, Education, Media industry, Retail, Real Estate, Science & Research activities like Large Hadron collider, Astronomy and Sports. The application of Big Data techniques and technologies in these domains has also been discussed to emphasize upon their importance in the present world leading to data-driven decision making. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

The data warehouse serves as the appropriate technology for effective and efficient data management, which is paramount to the success of precision dairy farming. This paper presents a joint effort between industry and academia on the experimental development of an active semantic data warehouse to support business intelligence and business analytics in precision dairy farming. The research follows an action research approach, deriving lessons for theory and practice from a set of actions taken in the course of the project. Among these actions are the development of a loading stage to facilitate data integration, the definition of an analysis view as well as the introduction of semantic OLAP patterns to facilitate analysis, and analysis rules to automate periodic analyses. The large volumes of generated sensor data in precision dairy farming required careful decision-making concerning the appropriate level of detail of the data stored in the data warehouse. Semantic technologies played a key role in rendering analysis accessible to end users. Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 [Christoph G.

American liaison librarians face new demands in data management due to expanding public access guidelines. This article gives advice for librarians new to data management, with the specific case of agriculture. For librarians supporting agriculture, the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [USDA NIFA] data management plan [DMP] requirements are a challenge and an opportunity. Agricultural libraries can learn to support faculty in how to write a plan that addresses the NIFA DMP sections of expected data type, data format, data storage and preservation, data sharing and public access, roles and responsibilities, and monitoring and reporting. Particular challenges that arise for DMPs in agrisciences include the diversity of subjects, multiple metadata and taxonomic systems, and the heterogeneity of research and data. To deal with this, data consultations are particularly critical. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018, © Nina Exner.","Funding; institutional repository; researchers; scholarly communications","","","","","","USDA NIFA; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA","One of the agencies requiring DMPs is the United States Department of Agriculture [USDA].

A key requirement for treecrop applications is the ability to associate sensed data to the individual trees in an orchard. A mobile ground robot with a scanning lidar (laser range sensor) is used to build a three dimensional (3D) model of an orchard and algorithms are derived to automatically detect and segment each tree. The height profile of each canopy is used to match the tree to a previously obtained database, to determine the location of the robot in the orchard, and to associate newly obtained agronomic data to the existing database. Experiments were conducted over 16 months in a 2.3 ha section of an almond orchard in Mildura, Victoria. An average tree segmentation accuracy of 99.1% was obtained, and the localisation accuracy was 98.2% for data obtained one full year apart. The method is sufficiently accurate to provide a feasible mechanism for localisation and data management in orchard environments.","Intelligent information systems; Precision-agriculture; Robotics; Sensing","","","","","","","","Douillard B., Underwood J.P., Kuntz N., Vlaskine V., Quadros A., Morton P., Frenkel A., On the segmentation of 3d lidar point clouds, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) (Shanghai, China), (2011); Jagbrant G., Underwood J.P., Nieto J., Sukkarieh S., Lidar based tree and platform localisation in almond orchards, Field and Service Robotics (FSR), pp. 469-483, (2015); Underwood J.P., Jagbrant G., Nieto J., Sukkarieh S., Lidar-based tree recognition and platform localization in orchards, J.

The insight of this paper is that lossy compression can unleash the power of compression to IoT because, as compared with its counterpart (a lossless one), it can significantly reduce the data volume when the spatiotemporal characteristics of IoT sensor data are properly exploited. However, lossy compression faces the challenge of compressing too much data thus losing data fidelity, which might affect the quality of the data and potential analytics outcomes. To understand the impact of lossy compression on IoT data management and analytics, we evaluated four classification algorithms with reconstructed agricultural sensor data based on various energy concentration. Specifically, we applied three transformation-based lossy compression mechanisms to five real-world weather datasets collected at different sampling granularities from IoT weather stations. Our experimental results indicate that there is a strong positive correlation between the concentrated energy of the transformed coefficients and the compression ratio as well as the data quality. While we observed a general trend where much higher compression ratios can be achieved at the cost of a decrease in quality, we also observed that the impact on the classification accuracy varies among the data sets and algorithms we evaluated. Lastly, we show that the sampling granularity also influences the data fidelity in terms of the prediction performance and compression ratio. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data fidelity; IoT; Lossy compression; Signal processing; Smart farm","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Data compression ratio; Data handling; Information management; Internet of things; Quality control; Signal processing; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Data fidelity; Higher compression ratios; Lossy compressions; Prediction performance; Smart farms; Spatiotemporal characteristics; accuracy assessment; agricultural application; algorithm; analytical method; data acquisition; data management; data set; regression analysis; sensor; signal processing; Big data","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1751143); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (CRC-15-01-KIST); National Research Council of Science and Technology, NST; National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1751143 .

However, many technologies and standards are not yet included on those practices. Therefore, potential benefits that may result from putting together agronomic knowledge with electronics and computer technologies are still not fully accomplished. Both emergent and established paradigms, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing, together with increasingly cheaper computing technologies – with very low power requirements and a diversity of wireless technologies, available to exchange data with increased efficiency – and intelligent systems, have evolved to a level where it is virtually possible to expeditiously create and deploy any required monitoring solution. Pushed by all of these technological trends and recent developments, data integration has emerged as the layer between crops and knowledge needed to efficiently manage it. In this paper, the mySense environment is presented, aimed to systematize data acquisition procedures to address common PA/PV issues. mySense builds over a 4-layer technological structure: sensor and sensor nodes, crop field and sensor networks, cloud services and support to front-end applications. It makes available a set of free tools based on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) concept and enables the use of Arduino® and Raspberry Pi (RPi) low-cost platforms to quickly prototype a complete monitoring application. Field experiments provide compelling evidences that mySense environment represents an important step forward towards Smart Farming, by enabling the use of low-cost, fast deployment, integrated and transparent technologies to increase PA/PV monitoring applications adoption. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Data integration; Internet of things; Precision agriculture; Precision viticulture; Smart farming","Rubus glaucus; Costs; Crops; Data acquisition; Data integration; Fog computing; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Precision agriculture; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Crop management practices; Electronics and Computer technologies; Internet of Things (IOT); Management environments; Monitoring applications; Precision viticulture; Smart farming; Technological structures; computer; crop yield; data acquisition; data management; farming system; knowledge based system; precision agriculture; sensor; viticulture; World Wide Web; Information management","","","","","ERDF-European Regional Development Fund; Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/EEA/50014/2013); Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e Neuroproteção, INCT-EN; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000038); Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC, (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961)","The authors would like to acknowledge ERDF and North 2020 – North Regional Operational Program, as part of project “INNOVINE&WINE – Vineyard and Wine Innovation Platform” (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000038) for partial funding as well as the ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation - COMPETE 2020 Programme within project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961, and by National Funds through the FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) as part of project UID/EEA/50014/2013.

To these purposes, the setting up of specific methodologies, for precision Farming Management System (FMS), is required the use of sensors and Geomatics techniques and optimization of field operation with the aim to build a precision Farming Management System (FMS) enhancing the agricultural performance and ability to predict and mitigate environmental risks. The research activities here presented belong to a multidisciplinary project named “PFRLab: Setting of a Precision Farming Robotic Laboratory for cropping system sustainability and food safety and security” founded by the Università Politecnica delle Marche during the period 2017–2020. The main goal of the research is to design a database for data management based on agriculture ontology, using as case study the experimental farm of Università Politecnica delle Marche. To solved this task, many data have been connected by advanced technologies like Unmanned (UAV), Internet of Things (IoT), Remote Sensing and field sensors. In the future, the big amount of field data allow building a Decision Support System to increase the performances of precision farming experimental trials and making farm’s decision potentially more productive and efficient. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data processing; Geodatabase; GIS; Ontology; Precision farming; Remote sensing","Agricultural robots; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Food safety; Information management; Internet of things; Ontology; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Advanced technology; Agricultural operations; Environmental quality; Environmental risks; Experimental trials; Internet of Things (IOT); Multidisciplinary projects; Research activities; Agriculture","","","","","","","Bansal N., Malink S.K., A framework for agriculture ontology development in semantic web, 2011 International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT), (2011); Burroughmcdonnell P.A., Principles of Geographic Information Systems, (1998); Chen X., Zhou D., Zhou N., Tan Z., Systematic analysis model for regional water resources based on a spatial information system, Proceedings of International Symposium, Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems for Design and Operation of Water Resources Systems, pp. 43-51, (1997); Hung Q.N., Nhien-An L.-K., Tahar K., Ontology Based Approach for Precision Agri-Colture: 2Th International Conference, (2018); Jayaraman P.P., Yavari A., Georfakopoulos D., Morshed A., Zaslavsky A., Internet of things platform for smart farming: Experiences and lessons learnt, Sensors, 16, 11, (2016); Kunal S., Sharda S., Ranbir Singh R., Aditya R., Vaibhav K., Arun K., Application of GIS in precision agriculture, Conference Paper October 2015, (2015); Li D., Kang L., Cheng X., Li D., Wang K., Et al., An ontology-based representation and implement method for crop cultivation standard, Mathematical and Computer Modeling, 58, 3-4, pp. 466-473, (2013); Malinverni E.S., Chiappini S., Pierdicca R., A Geodatabase for Multisource Data Management Applied to Cultural Heritage: The Case Study of Villa Buonaccorsi’s Historical Garden The International Archives of The Photogrammetry, (2019); Moran M.S., Inoue Y., Barnes E.M., Opportunities and limitations for image-based remote sensing in precision crop management, Remote Sensing of Environment, 61, pp. 319-346, (1997); Multilingual Agricultural Thesaurus (AGROVOC), (2018); Orsini R., Basili D., Belletti M., Bentivoglio D., Bozzi C.A., Chiappini S., Et al., Setting of a precision farming robotic laboratory for cropping system sustainability and food safety and security: Preliminary results, In 1St Workshop on Metrology for Agriculture and Forestry (METROAGRIFOR) IOP Conf.

We discuss the state of models relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional, and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases, namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate model results to society. We argue that these limitations are greater obstacles to progress than gaps in conceptual theory or available methods for using system models. New initiatives on open data show promise for addressing the data problem, but there also needs to be a cultural change among agricultural researchers to ensure that data for addressing the range of Use Cases are available for future model improvements and applications. We conclude that multiple platforms and multiple models are needed for model applications for different purposes. The Use Cases provide a useful framework for considering capabilities and limitations of existing models and data. © 2016 The Authors","Agricultural data; Crop models; Economic models; Integrated agricultural systems models; Livestock models; Use cases","agricultural modeling; agricultural research; cultural change; data management; economic analysis; farming system; integrated approach; knowledge; livestock; product development","","","","","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/M021386/1)","","Adams R.M., Rosenzweig C., Peart R.M., Ritchie J.T., McCarl B.M., Glyer J.D., Curry R.B., Jones J.W., Boote K.J., Allen L.H., Global climate change and U.S. agriculture: an interdisciplinary assessment, Nature, 345, pp. 219-224, (1990); AFRC, Energy and protein requirements of ruminants, An Advisory Manual Prepared by the AFRC Technical Committee on Response to Nutrients, (1993); AgMIP, Regional Integrated Assessments Handbook, (2014); Albarenque S.M., Basso B., Caviglia O.P., Melchiori R.J.M., Spatio-temporal nitrogen fertilizer response in maize: field study and modeling approach, Agron.

Many models are developed, there is much redundancy, models are often poorly coupled, model component re-use is rare, and it is frequently difficult to apply models to generate real solutions for the agricultural sector. To improve this situation, we argue that an open, self-sustained, and committed community is required to co-develop agricultural models and associated data and tools as a common resource. Such a community can benefit from recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT). We examine how such developments can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, and decision support tools for agricultural production systems. Our objective is to assess relevant technologies for their maturity, expected development, and potential to benefit the agricultural modeling community. The technologies considered encompass methods for collaborative development and for involving stakeholders and users in development in a transdisciplinary manner. Our qualitative evaluation suggests that as an overall research challenge, the interoperability of data sources, modular granular open models, reference data sets for applications and specific user requirements analysis methodologies need to be addressed to allow agricultural modeling to enter in the big data era. This will enable much higher analytical capacities and the integrated use of new data sources. Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications of their models. This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best practices as standard operating procedures. © 2016 The Authors","Agricultural models; Big data; ICT; Linked data; Open science; Sensing; Visualization","agricultural modeling; agricultural production; data management; data set; design; farming system; information and communication technology; knowledge; stakeholder; technological development; visualization","","","","","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (24960); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF","The authors like to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (24960) of their generous financial and organizational support for this work in defining the NextGen of agricultural systems models; this paper is largely drawn from a report to the Foundation (Janssen et al., 2015).

Proportional and simple random sampling techniques were used to select 69 male and 28 female extension personnel to give a total sample size of 97 respondents. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed with descriptive statistics (means and percentages) and the Pearson Product Moment correlation analysis. The findings show that the majority of the respondents who were mostly educated to the level of diploma (73%) agreed that knowledge of mathematics/statistics is the most important (x = 7.83) requirement for data management. It was also revealed that adequate training and workshops are important requirements (x = 7.60) for successful data management and enhance performance of staff particularly those involved in data collection as enumerators considering that the work is cumbersome. Pearson correlation analysis shows that there is link between educational qualification, job experience and training with level of understanding of the important aspects of data management. Proficiency in mathematics and statistics is the most important requirement for an effective data management as perceived by the KADA staff. However, extension personnel performance can be improved through training and staff motivation through allowance and provision of transportation facilities. The Kaduna State ministry of agriculture in collaboration with KADA should be committed to ensuring the actualization of the above mentioned strategies. © 2019, Agricultural Extension Society of Nigeria.","Capabilities; Data management; Extension personnel","","","","","","","","Abdullahi H.A., Mlozi M.R.S., Nzalayaimisi G.K., Determinants of students' academic achievement in agricultural sciences.

Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency, productivity and profitability of farming operations. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

As over the last years the industry is actively promoting ISOBUS, a number of sensor and control system appeared that are ISOBUS-compatible. These systems are focused on two main areas: (i) decision-making, where the sensors are usually mounted on the tractor and aim at varying the applied dose rates (seeds, fertilizer, etc.), and (ii) process monitoring, where they are mounted on the implement and monitor (and in some cases control) the proper application of the recommended dose rates. The aim of this review was to investigate the offered sensor and control systems and categorize them based on the performed application in order to better contextualize their importance. The relevant benefits by using them, but also the potential technical constraints based on their measuring elements were identified. The academic advances could not be missing from this review as all these years many researchers conducted ISOBUS-related research. The related publications were initially identified and later categorized from an operation-based perspective into three main research areas: (a) guidance and control, (b) data acquisition and transfer, and (c) data management and analytics. The scientific advances that are described give an insight into what should be expected in the following years in terms of commercially available solutions. Identified gaps and future challenges related to ISOBUS conclude this review providing, thus, expected future technical innovations but also potential research directions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural standard; Digital twins; ISOBUS; Machine communication; Precision farming","Agriculture; Control systems; Data acquisition; Decision making; Information management; Process monitoring; Digital twins; Guidance and control; ISOBUS; Machine communications; Potential researches; Precision farming; Technical constraints; Technical innovation; control system; data acquisition; data management; innovation; literature review; machinery; precision agriculture; sensor; Industrial research","","","","","Federal Office for Agriculture and Food; German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture; ICT-AGRI; H2020 Food, FOOD, (2815ERA01H, 2817ERA09H); H2020 Food, FOOD; Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft, BMEL","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the ICT-AGRI ERA-NET projects ifarma-ffa and iFAROS and was financially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE), grant numbers 2815ERA01H and 2817ERA09H.

The precondition for the new SDI were to be compliant with the European initiative for spatial information (INSPIRE), to consider FAIR data principles, to be interoperable with other disciplinary national and international SDIs and to support dataset registrations with digital object identifiers (DOI). To meet these requirements, the new SDI had to support both the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata standards. As there was no metadata standard available that supported both metadata schemas from different disciplines, it became necessary to merge these two existing standards. The objective of this paper is to describe the developmental steps of the newly created BonaRes metadata schema for geospatial soil-agricultural research data. First, we analyzed the INSPIRE and DataCite metadata schemas, identified and compared semantically equivalent metadata elements, including properties and allowed content values, for potential mapping. In the next step, we specified the new metadata model, whose elements were derived from INSPIRE or DataCite under consideration of the previously developed mapping. Third, additional metadata elements were defined to directly describe the underlying data model. The advantages and disadvantages of the method that was applied to define the BonaRes metadata schema elements originating from INSPIRE and DataCite schemas are presented and discussed. By implementing the new metadata model, the SDIs can achieve cross-portal metadata interoperability with other INSPIRE-compliant SDIs. Furthermore, researchers who store their geospatial research data in SDIs to implement the BonaRes metadata schema can increase the visibility and findability of their research, as the data can be assigned a DOI, which is a prerequisite for data citations and data publications. The new metadata elements of the BonaRes metadata schema allows targeted dataset queries, e.g., soil pH values, yields or parameters, which were measured by a specific method, using the underlying data model, and improves the discovery and reusability of research data. © 2019 The Authors","BonaRes Repository; Crosswalk; DataCite 4.0; FAIR data principles; INSPIRE; Metadata mapping; Metadata schema","Germany; Agriculture; Crosswalks; Mapping; Reusability; Soils; BonaRes Repository; DataCite 4.0; FAIR data principles; INSPIRE; Metadata mappings; Metadata schema; agriculture; data management; mapping; metadata; soil; spatial data; Metadata","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; BonaRes, (031B0511B); BonaRes","This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the funding measure “Soil as a Sustainable Resource for the Bioeconomy – BonaRes”, project “BonaRes (Module B): BonaRes Centre for Soil Research, subproject B” (grant 031B0511B ).

The system via dual-line decoding technology, and a variety of sensors were used to collect the parameters of crop growth environment for each individual protected agriculture in real-time. Then all kinds of collected data were timely transmitted and stored in cloud data management platform. Thereafter, the ability of calculation and analysis from cloud calculated cluster was used, water and fertilizer needs, irrigation and fertilization system in protected agriculture under different environmental conditions for crop growth were scientifically determined to achieve intelligent control of water and fertilizer integration. The system was of great importance in guiding protected agriculture to achieve high yield, high quality, ecology and safety in production. Two application examples in planting bases of protected agriculture showed that compared with the traditional irrigation methods, the intelligent cloud irrigation system based on the technology of dual-line decoding and cloud computing to manage integrated water and fertilizer for protected agriculture can improve the water use efficiency by 25%~40% and fertilizer use efficiency by 15%~35%, which shortened labor time and decreased labor force sharply. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

The statistics module processes the data entered by the farmer and provides statistical data for several parameters specific to cattle farms, such as: X, ±s x, s, V%, genetic parameters (heritability, correlations, repetability) and the genetic evaluation of the sires, with the BLUP option. The main modules of the application are: user interface (GUI), business logic module (Business Logic Layer), the database access module (Data Acces Layer) and the statistics module (SAVC- variance and covariance statistical analysis). The uses programming language, Fox-Pro, is well structured and falls into the SGBDs category. The R.E.M.L. (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) linear programming – which is based on a function maximizing iterative process – was used to estimate the genetic parameters. The program called “C.O.P. & R.G” with the S.A.V.C. option was developed at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Iasi, Romania and it addresses farmers and units dealing with production recording and improving dairy cattle. © SGEM2017.

Applications range from goods delivery, agriculture, surveillance, mining, industrial inspection, disaster management etc. Furthermore, this vast usability of UAVs can be powered by Internet of Things (IoT) and it can offer a new IoT value-added services. UAVs can be referred to as 'things in motion' which can be controlled over the Internet and push the sensor data they collect to the cloud services. But this imposes major challenges with high a volume of data transmissions in some applications. Another area of concern is the choice of mode of communication in LOS (Line of Sight) and BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) where Wi-Fi could have limited accessibility and other modes like satellite communication have higher cost of data transmissions. In this paper, a RESTful approach to connect UAVs with IoT to stream sensor data to cloud services is presented, providing an efficient solution for data management and transmissions by efficiently gathering, filtering and transmitting data on demand to the cloud services. An efficient vertical handover mechanism is also presented between different modes of communication like Wi-Fi and satellite for BLOS communication challenges to increase reliability or reduce cost. © 2017 IEEE.","BLOS; Cloud Services; Cloudlets; Failover; IoT; Sensors; UAV","Competition; Data transfer; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Distributed database systems; Information management; Network security; Radio systems; Satellite communication systems; Sensors; Telecommunication links; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Web services; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); BLOS; Cloud services; Cloudlets; Failover; Industrial inspections; Internet of Things (IOT); Satellite communications; Seamless vertical handover; Internet of things","","","","","Ontario Centres of Excellence, OCE; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This project is partially funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE).

A design limitation required that the unit must be capable of fitting through a standard classroom door. The unit measures 203 centimeters by 71 centimeters (80 inches by 28 inches) and contains all the systematic sensors required to produce a yield map housed within a functioning field combine. The yield monitor is mobile and capable of producing a variable yield map within a classroom or laboratory. Such a platform allows students to focus on the precision agriculture technologies and not on operating the combine in a field. With the incorporation of a geographic information system (GIS), students have the opportunity to experience precision agriculture technologies, zone and data management principles in a laboratory setting. The use of a grain yield demonstration unit can greatly increase the learning opportunities within a laboratory setting, without the barriers associated with demonstrations in the field. The yield monitor demonstration unit will primarily be used in the AGM program laboratories and cooperative extension field day demonstrations by Clemson AGM instructors and extension associates to help educate students and growers about data management and sensor troubleshooting. © ASABE 2020 Annual International Meeting.","Data management; GIS; GPS system; Precision agriculture; Yield monitor; Zone","Agricultural robots; Demonstrations; Grain (agricultural product); Information management; Laboratories; Precision agriculture; Students; Agricultural mechanization; Clemson University; Demonstration units; Design limitations; Elevator systems; Learning opportunity; Management principles; Precision agriculture technology; Combines","","","","","Clemson University AGM Capstone Program","This work was supported and funded by Clemson University AGM Capstone Program; the undergraduate students enrolled in the capstone course (William Anderson, Cal Arnold, Drew Cole, Benjamin Fogle, Evan Ledford, Tyler Looper, Brennan Teddy) that put countless hours of work in the design and build of this project; Will Anderson’s donation of the combine components.

The cultural wisdom of processing raw ingredients into delicious dishes is embodied in their cuisines. Recipes thus are the cultural capsules that encode elaborate cooking protocols for evoking sensory satiation as well as providing nourishment. As we stand on the verge of an epidemic of diet-linked disorders, it is eminently important to investigate the culinary correlates of recipes to probe their association with sensory responses as well as consequences for nutrition and health. RecipeDB (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb) is a structured compilation of recipes, ingredients and nutrition profiles interlinked with flavor profiles and health associations. The repertoire comprises of meticulous integration of 118 171 recipes from cuisines across the globe (6 continents, 26 geocultural regions and 74 countries), cooked using 268 processes (heat, cook, boil, simmer, bake, etc.), by blending over 20 262 diverse ingredients, which are further linked to their flavor molecules (FlavorDB), nutritional profiles (US Department of Agriculture) and empirical records of disease associations obtained from MEDLINE (DietRx). This resource is aimed at facilitating scientific explorations of the culinary space (recipe, ingredient, cooking processes/techniques, dietary styles, etc.) linked to taste (flavor profile) and health (nutrition and disease associations) attributes seeking for divergent applications. © The Author(s) 2020.

The objective of the research was to measure the usability quality of raster data management module included in a geoportal, which is an improvement in the geoportal previously developed in a university. This module was subjected to a software quality analysis with the use of the ISO/IEC 25010: 2011 standard in the Usability feature and sub features of Operability and Learnability. To achieve this purpose, the GQM (Goal - Question - Metrics) methodology was used with which it has allowed to establish the goal that is a correct functionality of the raster data management software module; the questions were elaborated based on the SUS questionnaire (System Usability Scale) and has developed metrics to measure the quality in Operability and Learnability. The data obtained were analyzed statistically through the Levene’s test for equality of variances and means, and Spearman correlation. The results show that there is a moderate and positive correlation between both factors Operability and Learnability, which means that the greater the perception of operability, the greater the perception in learnability. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

This approach is labor intensive, has low working efficiency, and makes the quality of test data inferior to that of the seed threshing monitor system adopted by developed countries. To solve this problem, a type of harvester seed threshing monitoring system was designed on the basis of a plot seed threshing machine that mainly includes a host computer part and a slave computer part. The single MSP430 chip from TI Company was applied to the slave computer, which can acquire such information as productivity of the harvester, grain moisture content, environmental temperature, environmental humidity, and geographic positioning system (GPS), with a measurement unit such as grain moisture sensor, gravity sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and the GPS module. The host computer used the embedded touch panel as the human-computer interface, which can run the MCGS software. The host computer and slave computer communicated with each other through an RS-232 serial port and the Modbus protocol. This system can automatically make accurate corresponding relations between block number and related production data, and has data management capability such as mass data import and export using a USB flash drive. The scheme of the harvester seed threshing monitoring system was proved correct and could be used feasibly in a virtual experiment. This system can clearly improve the seed threshing test production efficiency and data accuracy.","Bionic corn seed threshing machine; Cloud platform; Rough sets; Single chip","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Digital storage; Efficiency; Grain (agricultural product); Harvesters; Information management; Interfaces (computer); Moisture; Moisture control; Network protocols; Rough set theory; Units of measurement; Virtual reality; Cloud platforms; Corn seeds; Corresponding relations; Environmental humidities; Environmental temperature; Human computer interfaces; Management capabilities; Single chips; Monitoring","","","","","","","Zhang X., Yi K., Gao L., Contacting mechanics analysis during impact process between corn seeds and threshing component, Chinese Agricultural Science Bulletin, 3, 3, pp. 89-92, (2015); Zhang X.W., Yi K.C., Huang M., Et al., 3D solid model establishment and finite element analysis of corn seed, Advance Journal of Food Science & Technology, 11, 8, pp. 90-93, (2016); Zhang X., Gao L., Research of mechanical cracks extension process in corn seed, Journal of Chinese Agricultural Mechanization, 2, 1, (2014); Li X., Ma Y., Jin X., Et al., Design and test of corn seed bionic thresher, Nongye Jixie Xuebao/transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery, 46, 7, pp. 97-101, (2015); Yang X., Hong H., You Z., Et al., Spectral and image integrated analysis of hyperspectral data for waxy corn seed variety classification, Sensors, 15, 7, pp. 15578-15594, (2015); Suksoon L., Yun S.H., Yang S.K., Et al., Characteristics of sweet and super sweet corn seeds shelled at different seed moisture and threshing method conditions, Korean Journal of Crop Science, 51, 51, pp. 632-638, (2006); Shi F.J., Zeng S.R., Ye Y.-X., Et al., Discussion on the corn seed production in northwest cold area, Modern Agricultural Science & Technology, 3, 8, pp. 12-15, (2016); Araujo E.F., Miranda G.V., Araujo R.F., Et al., Storability of sweetcorn seeds subjected to different threshing methods, Revista Brasileira de Armazenamento, 2, 3, pp. 65-71, (2006); Pan B., Ren J., Zhao G., Germination and vigor of sweet corn seeds with seed soaking time, Journal of Zhejiang A & F University, 6, 3, pp. 55-59, (2015); Yan H., Long D., Corn-seed modeling and simulation analysis based on shape features, Applied Mechanics & Materials, 602-605, pp. 779-782, (2014)","","","TeknoScienze","","","","","","17226996","","","","English","Agro Food Ind.

However, the problems still exist in the development process, such as low labor productivity, high production cost, low land productivity, low yield, low rate of resource utilization and lacking international competitiveness of agricultural products. One important reason for these problems lies in the low agricultural mechanization level in China. The informationization of agricultural machinery is a fundamental way to enhance agricultural mechanization level. In order to keep the sustained growth of agricultural mechanization level and accomplish the agricultural sustainable development in China, it is critical to take full advantages of advanced information technology to improve the design, manufacturing, operation and management of agricultural machinery, and then to enhance the level of agricultural mechanization. This paper mainly introduced: 1) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery design: parametric design, agricultural machinery product design based on knowledge engineering, and concurrent and collaborative design based on product data management; 2) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery manufacturing: flexible manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing, and virtual and network manufacturing; 3) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery operation: agricultural information acquisition, agricultural machinery navigation, and field management; 4) The key information technologies for agricultural machinery management: agricultural machinery management, and agricultural machinery scheduling. The deficiencies of current information technologies were analyzed, the development trend was summarized for the countries all over the world, and the core issues of enhancing the agricultural mechanization level in China for present information technologies were proposed. In order to further enhance the level of agricultural mechanization by using information technology, some suggestions are proposed in this paper: 1) To make the breakthrough in key technologies of digital design of intelligent equipment, coordinated control of auto-navigation and fieldbus technology of agricultural equipment; 2) To strengthen the innovation of major precision production equipment, such as precision production equipment for field operation and facilities agriculture, orchard production and livestock, and poultry and aquaculture production; 3) To construct the precision operating system for modern agricultural machinery, and to research and develop a series of major technical products, such as precision operating system of water, fertilizer and pesticide, automatic feeding system and automated processing production line of livestock, poultry and aquaculture. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Since several techniques for information management exist, the aim is how to integrate them for a sustainable management of vineyards areas in Kosovo. It has been designed a system, which is able to produce maps, make various analyses based on the requests of the specific users and offers trend orientation for decision making. The JAVA programming language has been used. This provides the most possible flexibility in the data flow and data management. The structure of the data base is proposed to be designed in that way that the textual and geometric data have been processed in a unique data base in PostGIS PostgreSQL technology. Web GIS technology presented in this paper, shows an advantage comparing to the desktop based technology since it enables an access in real time. Foremost, the application offers an access depending on the roles and privileges for different users. Development of a WEB application for viticulture management will improve the efficiency and decision making process as well. Results show numerous capabilities of GIS methodologies to manage the agricultural crops, in this particular case, the vineyards. Further, the results provide insight into information management in a single system and serve as a basis for similar researches in other areas of agriculture in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).","GIS; GPS; Map; Vineyard; WEB application","Kosovo; database; decision making; GIS; GPS; map; sustainability; vineyard; viticulture","","","","","","","Achilleos G., Allocating the DEM elevation error into its components: The contribution of digitazing and interpolation to the total error, Proceedings Vol. 1, 4Th International Conference on Cartography and GIS, pp. 139-148; (2019); Bandrova T., Konecny M., Yotova A., Cartography Development and Chalanges on the Basis of Big Data. 5Th International Conference on Cartography and GIS, Proceedings, 1, pp. 164-173, (2014); (2019); Campbell E.J., Shin M., Geographic Information System Basics (V. 1.0), (2012); Clay A.S.H., GIS Applications in Agriculture, (2011); Danko K., Springer Handbook of Geographic Information, (2012); Drishti B., GIS Ne Planifikimin E Zhvillimit Te Qendrueshem Te Nje Rajoni, (2012); GIS Best Practices.

A first step is the assessment of farmer needs. For this purpose, an internet survey was developed to gather feedback from farmers about the use of currently available herd management tools as well as the present status of documentation and recording of relevant data. End of 2014 a questionnaire was designed comprising 23 questions. It was distributed end of February 2015 and could be completed until April 10,2015. In total 9,961 dairy farmers were contacted. The response rate was 19.1% in farmers. Currently, a large proportion of external information to be used for herd management is received in paper or in pdf-format and is thus not further processible. Hence, farmers request the integration of different data in platforms for data exchange or internet platforms. Farmers get a wealth of information from different documentations. A large number of farmers expect substantial support for herd management (76.5%) and early detection of farm problems (71.5%) by means of this information. When asked for necessary developments, farmers have the highest interest (78.1%) in better integration of data of already existing systems (e.g. milking, feeding, performance testing) and external herd management information (e.g. veterinary treatment, results of laboratory analysis) in order to avoid multiple recording. The combination of data from different data sources could support farmers in day-To-day work. However, data security aspects need be payed particular attention. © 2018 Verlag Eugen Ulmer.

Aiming at the problem in low integral level of agricultural machinery research and development in China, as well as various types and significant regional differences result in a variety of professional knowledge, structural forms, practical experience and so on, making it difficult for individual designers to fully grasp, unable to guarantee the quality of research and development, and severely restricting the industrial development and independent innovation ability, thus the development process of design methods was comprehensively reviewed, the characteristics of times at each stage and the generation rules of advanced design methods were analyzed, the advanced design methods and development direction suitable for agricultural equipment was discussed, and the realization of the strategic goals set for agricultural equipment in major national development plans such as ""Made in China 2025"" was supported. The research showed that the trend of intelligent design based on digital technology was obvious, which represented the development direction and the highest level of advanced design by combining the current technological level and social background, making full use of the advantages of 3D-CAD virtual reality and the development results of computer technology. Intelligent design was characterized by knowledge reuse, based on digital model resource, carried by product data management (PDM) and product lifecycle management (PLM) platform, and organized and connected upstream and downstream design-related research links such as scheme reasoning, digital mockup (DMU), computer aided engineering (CAE), computer aided process planning (CAPP) by the generalized computer aided design concept. In this way, intelligent design can implement the high integration of CAX, which was the practical application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of design. The development ideas of current advanced design were clarified, basic theory and system architecture for the establishment of equipment intelligent design system were provided, and it had significant theoretical value and practical guiding significance for fully integrating industry resources, highly sharing achievements and professional knowledge, greatly improving research and development efficiency and level, and significantly enhancing the core competitiveness of Chinese equipment enterprises and their products. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

In today's world condition, the existence of humans is not possible without the essential proliferation of plants. In the photosynthesis procedure, plants use solar energy to convert into chemical energy. This process is responsible for all life on earth, and the main controlling factor for proper plant growth is soil since it holds water, air, and all essential nutrients of plant nourishment. Though, due to overexposure, soil gets despoiled, so fertilizer is an essential component to hold the soil quality. In that regard, soil analysis is a suitable method to determine soil quality. Soil analysis examines the soil in laboratories and generates reports of unorganized and insignificant data. In this study, different big data analysis machine learning methods are used to extracting knowledge from data to find out fertilizer recommendation classes on behalf of present soil nutrition composition. For this experiment, soil analysis reports are collected from the Tata soil and water testing center. In this paper, Mahoot library is used for analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), artificial neural network (ANN) performance on Hadoop environment. For better performance evaluation, we also used single machine experiments for random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors K-NN, regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM) using polynomial function, SVM using radial basis function (RBF) methods. Detailed experimental analysis was carried out using overall accuracy, AUC-ROC (receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC)) curve, mean absolute prediction error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) validation measurements on soil reports dataset. The results provide a comparison of solution classes and conclude that the SGD outperforms other approaches. Finally, the proposed results support to select the solution or recommend a class which suggests suitable fertilizer to crops for maximum production. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture industry; Artificial neural network (ANN); Big data analytics; Fertilizer recommendations; Hadoop framework; K-NN; Random forest (RF); Regression tree (RT); Stochastic gradient descent (SGD); Sustainability-oriented performance; SVM","agricultural technology; agroindustry; algorithm; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; comparative study; conceptual framework; data management; fertilizer application","","","","","Department of Computer Engineering; Department of Engineering; Department of Industrial Engineering; Punjabi University; Tata Chemical Limited Soil and Water Testing Laboratory; University of Naples Parthenope","The authors thank Tata Chemical Limited Soil and Water Testing Laboratory for provided Soil reports.

The monitoring of such environmental factors allows for the development of appropriate strategies to reduce detrimental effects of sub-optimal air quality on the respiratory health of both livestock and farmers. In 2009, an environmental monitoring system was designed, developed and tested that allowed for the monitoring of a number of airborne pollutants. One limitation of the system was the manual collection of logged data from each unit. This paper identifies limitations of the current environmental monitoring system and suggests a range of networking technologies that can be used to increase usability. Consideration is taken for the networking of environmental monitoring units, as well as the collection of recorded data. Furthermore, the design and development of a software system that is used to collate and store recorded environmental data from multiple farms is explored. In order to design such a system, simplified software engineering processes and methodologies have been utilised. The main steps taken in order to complete the project were requirements elicitation with clients, requirements analysis, system design, implementation and finally testing. The outcome of the project provided a potential prototype for improving the environmental monitoring system and analysis informing the benefit of the implementation. © 2017 China Agricultural University","Environmental monitoring; Networking; Sensors; Software engineering","Agriculture; Air quality; Data acquisition; Environmental engineering; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Information management; Requirements engineering; Sensors; Software engineering; Design and Development; Environmental factors; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental monitoring system; Networking; Networking technology; Requirements elicitation; Software engineering process; air quality; data management; environmental monitoring; livestock; networking; sensor; software; Monitoring","","","","","","","Wathes C.M., Phillips V.R., Holden M.R., Sneath R.W., Short J.L., White R.P.P., Et al., Emissions of aerial pollutants in livestock buildings in northern Europe: overview of a multinational project, J Agric Eng Res, 70, 1, pp. 3-9, (1998); Banhazi T.M., Seedorf J., Rutley D.L., Pitchford W.S., Identification of risk factors for sub-optimal housing conditions in Australian piggeries: Part 1.

In a given standard SWAT application, multiple potential HRUs (farm fields) in a subbasin are usually aggregated into a single HRU feature. In other words, the standard version of the model combines multiple potential HRUs (farm fields) with the same landuse/landcover, soil, and slope, but located at different places of a subbasin (spatially non-unique), and considers them as one HRU. In this study, ArcGIS pre-processing procedures were developed to spatially define a one-to-one match between farm fields and HRUs (spatially unique HRUs) within a subbasin prior to SWAT simulations to facilitate input processing, input/output mapping, and further analysis at the individual farm field level. Model input data such as landuse/landcover (LULC), soil, crop rotation, and other management data were processed through these HRUs. The SWAT model was then calibrated/validated for Raccoon River watershed in Iowa for 2002–2010 and Big Creek River watershed in Illinois for 2000–2003. SWAT was able to replicate annual, monthly, and daily streamflow, as well as sediment, nitrate and mineral phosphorous within recommended accuracy in most cases. The one-to-one match between farm fields and HRUs created and used in this study is a first step in performing LULC change, climate change impact, and other analyses in a more spatially explicit manner. © 2015, The Author(s).","Calibration; Flow; HRUs; Landuse; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Agriculture; Calibration; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Hydrology; Illinois; Iowa; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Rivers; Soil; Water; Water Movements; Water Quality; Big Creek; Illinois; Iowa; Iowa; Raccoon River; United States; Procyon; Aggregates; Agriculture; Calibration; Climate change; Land use; Rain; Watersheds; mineral; nitrate; nitric acid derivative; soil; water; Agricultural watersheds; Calibration and validations; Flow; HRUs; Hydrologic response units; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Watershed modeling; agricultural modeling; calibration; climate change; data management; environmental assessment; flow modeling; GIS; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land use change; management practice; planning method; watershed; Article; calibration; climate change; crop rotation; fertilizer application; land use; model; sediment; soil aggregation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; validation process; water management; water quality; watershed; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; hydrology; Illinois; Iowa; pollution; procedures; river; soil; theoretical model; validation study; water flow; water quality; Soils","","nitrate, 14797-55-8; water, 7732-18-5; Nitrates, ; Soil, ; Water, ","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, SBE, (1009925)","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1009925.

As the water supply from rainfall is not enough or its distribution is not appropriate to satisfy the water requirements of the crop and since the availability of water is reduced during the two seasons of low rainfall in the Cauca river valley, it is necessary to develop strategies to improve irrigation management. Timely programming of irrigation using sensors to monitor the matric potential of the soil is a strategy that contributes to this objective. In the Research Center of Sugar Cane of Colombia (Cenicaña) research has been undertaken to allow the development of technologies for the use of sensors for the irrigation management in sugarcane crops. The technology is composed by sensors inserted in the soil, the acquisition system, the storage and transmission of data, and the data management and visualization application. In addition, the criteria that must be taken into account for the use of this technology were determined. In a pilot phase, an IoT network was installed in fields cultivated with cane in the Cauca river valley, in order to measure the matric potential of the soil and use it for irrigation scheduling. The results obtained allowed to establish that the threshold to begin the cane crops irrigations is of −85Â kPa. It was determined that the matric potential sensors are useful devices for the cane irrigation control, which can be permanently installed in the field to take information manually or automated. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Internet of the Things; Matric potencial of the soil; Sugarcane","Climate change; Crops; Data visualization; Digital storage; Information management; Irrigation; Landforms; Rain; Research and development management; Rivers; Soils; Sugar cane; Water supply; Acquisition systems; Irrigation controls; Irrigation management; Irrigation scheduling; Monitoring stations; Transmission of data; Visualization application; Water requirements; Internet of things","","","","","","","Bittelli M., Measuring soil water content: A review, Horttechnology, 21, 3, pp. 293-300, (2011); Kalita H., Palaparthy V.S., Baghini M.S., Aslam M., Graphene quantum dot soil moisture sensor, Sens.

At present, all of Chinese agricultural machine enterprises generally focus on tracking and copying foreign agricultural machinery product, which lead to problems such as long development cycle, low efficiency of design knowledge reuse, and poor product reliability. The low competitiveness of products and lack of core independent technologies have bottlenecked the sustainable development of agricultural machine enterprises in China. To meet the diversified needs of users as the goal, intelligent design technology with knowledge based engineering (KBE), data management (DM), artificial intelligence (AI), virtual simulation technology and other modern information technology as means, the synergistic, automatic and intelligent design of agricultural machinery can be realized by integrating existing resources of related enterprises in the whole life cycle of agricultural machinery and product data management/product lifecycle management (PDM/PLM) collaborative design platform. It's the key to improve the design level of agricultural machinery in China. Based on the characteristics of agricultural machinery, the definition, technical system, key technology and development status of intelligent design technology for agricultural machinery were introduced. The current situation and future development trends of the key technologies in intelligent design technology for agricultural machinery such as computer aided design (CAD), modular design, knowledge based engineering, virtual simulation, PDM/PLM collaborative design were deeply analyzed in recent years. And the reference suggestions for the research direction of agricultural machinery design were put forward. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

However, review and expert interviews with German farmers show that available solutions mostly are standalone systems. They lack compatibility with other technologies like already existing Information Systems and automation technology in dairy stables (e.g. climate-control, energy management or robotic milking). Farmers and researchers wish for a solution that integrates sensor systems, the control of actuators and existing information systems on dairy farms into one central information- and control-system. Moreover, an option to provide customized user interfaces to different stakeholders is required. This research shows, that a digital broker model as middleware offers manufacturer-independent opportunities to integrate existing information systems, wide arrays of different sensors and data transmission technologies. It further takes care of data management issues. The example of the TUM dairy research farm is shown, where a broker model is being implemented for research and teaching. Results show, that a broker model is a powerful tool to overcome most compatibility and connectivity issues and provides the desired solutions. However special aspects regarding connectivity must be taken into consideration on a dairy farm. Different transmission technologies are needed for different tasks, as a dairy farm offers very diverse conditions for IoT technology implementation. Customized user interfaces can be provided. Research is necessary regarding regulatory issues, and manufacturers need to be won over by the benefits of these systems, so that an integration of their technologies is facilitated. © 2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

These models rely heavily on observational data, typically collected from sensors. Increasingly this data comes from a wide range of sources. For example, agricultural models often require data from climate observations, soil conditions, on-farm equipment, seasonal forecasts, among others. Integration of these data with models is very time-consuming and often is repetitious across different models. Furthermore, automation of model runs is difficult due to the complexity of managing data dependencies. We have developed a distributed system, Senaps, to support automation of sensor data retrieval and coupling with model execution in a scalable way. It has been developed over many years across scientific disciplines, including water management, agriculture, aquaculture, and related Information, Communication and Technologies areas. It has been used, and is in use, by a diverse range of projects, resulting in a flexible system that is not tied to a specific domain. Senaps includes a publish-subscribe subsystem that handles ingestion of disparate time-series data. It supports stream processing, such as quality assurance and data checking, and automates data ingestion with monitoring and recovery. The storage and access subsystem is a scalable time-series backend with an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow third party developers to build on. It has a range of features including dynamic temporal aggregations; fine-grained access control to support data privacy and sharing (users can elect to share data between organisations); metadata for sensor data management; and controlled vocabularies. The focus of this paper is the model integration subsystem, which provides the model integration and automation features. This system builds on developments in cloud and container-based computing to isolate a user submitted model’s runtime environment and provide access to the data backend. APIs are provided to handle environment images (e.g. Linux with R), model definition, workflows (instances of a model), and running of model jobs. We have successfully used this system to automate model runs and provide continuous results from a number of parameterised models. We have hosted a number of models on the platform, including a timber drying model and two agricultural prediction models. Being tied to a robust sensor-data backend ensures models are run on the most recent data and removes the need for model developers to continuously manage model execution. Results from the model are automatically available and can be easily shared between users and organisations. In this paper, we detail the technical challenges in implementation, provide example results from a running model, and describe our next research steps. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

However, water pollution in fish farming ponds is regarded as the leading cause of fish death and financial losses in the market. Here, an Internet of Things system based on a cubic multidimensional integration of circuit (MD-IC) is demonstrated for water and food security applications in fish farming ponds. Both faces of the silicon substrate are used for thin-film-based device fabrication. The devices are interconnected via through-silicon-vias, resulting in a bifacial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible electronics system. The demonstrated cubic MD-IC is a complete, small, and lightweight system that can be easily deployed by farmers with no need for specialists. The system integrates on its outer sides simultaneous air and water quality monitoring devices (temperature, electrical conductivity, ammonia, and pH sensors), solar cells for energy-harvesting, and antenna for real-time data-transfer, while data-management circuitry and a solid-state battery are integrated on its internal faces. Microfluidic cooling technology is used for thermal management in the MD-IC. Finally, a biofriendly polymeric encapsulation is used to waterproof the embedded electronics, improve the mechanical robustness, and allow the system to float on the surface of the water. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These technologies offer innovative solutions that allow producers to solve many of the problems in modern agriculture. The value provided by adoption of these technologies, and the resulting data, can potentially provide short and long-term benefits to farmers. However, often this value is unclear, leading to hesitation in the initiation and/or advancement of farmer’s investment in digital agriculture technologies. Proper technology selection and implementation varies by farm, level of technological aptitude, and available investment opportunities. In this project, various commercially available technologies were used to document data for a single field, and specifically for a single corn plant. This was done to understand the type and total amount of data being collected; a total of 18.5 Gb of data was collected from 2,476 individual files. These files were then categorized and ranked according to ease of adoption, added value, amount of generated data, and various other categories. Key data layers for the 2017 growing season were found to be as-planted, yield, imagery, seeding prescriptions, and weather data. Post-harvest analyses provided a means to separate data layers or files that provided direct value to the farmer. While impractical in commercial application, this platform served as a means to encourage adoption of these technologies and a determination of the many ways that data can be collected, analyzed, and acted upon in the current state of digital agriculture. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Conversely, they (the robots) can also consume data collected by other agents or made available on accessible database and repositories. In this paper, we propose a possible management of different services, exploiting the possibilities offered by cloud robotics in a complex scenario (smart city, smart agriculture, search & rescue). A high-level cloud platform manages several unmanned robots (UAVs and UGVs) with the goal of providing support to the end users that require it via a remote connection (web, SSH, VPN, etc.). The robots are used in the operating area while forwarding real-time data and video streaming to the final users, connected to the same cloud platform, that can manage them by remote. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","","Autonomous agents; Complex networks; Human computer interaction; Robotics; Robots; Smart city; Video streaming; Cloud platforms; Common networks; Data infrastructure; Different services; High level clouds; Robotic services; Smart agricultures; Unmanned robots; Information management","","","","","UAV; Telecom Italia; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH","Funding text 1: The two different products were (and are currently) used in the validation of the different architecture layers: PixHawk [7]: is an independent, open-hardware project aiming at providing high-end autopilot hardware to the academic, hobby and industrial communities at low costs and high availability.

However, the drought-related software and platform development lag behind the theoretical research. The current drought monitoring systems focus mainly on information management and publishing, and cannot implement professional drought monitoring or parameter inversion modelling, especially the models based on multi-dimensional feature space. In view of the above problems, this paper aims at fixing this gap with a component-based system named RSDMS to facilitate the application of drought monitoring by remote sensing. The system is designed and developed based on Component Object Model (COM) to ensure the flexibility and extendibility of modules. RSDMS realizes general image-related functions such as data management, image display, spatial reference management, image processing and analysis, and further provides drought monitoring and evaluation functions based on internal and external models. Finally, China’s Ningxia region is selected as the study area to validate the performance of RSDMS. The experimental results show that RSDMS provide an efficient and scalable support to agricultural drought monitoring. © 2017 Dong et al.

In fact, more and more farmers and food and agriculture companies are using precision agriculture-based systems to enhance not only their products themselves, but also their means of production. Consequently, problems arising from large amounts of data management and processing are arising. It would be very useful to have an infrastructure that allows information and agricultural tasks to be efficiently shared and handled. The cloud computing paradigm offers a solution. In this study, a cloud-based software architecture is proposed with the aim of enabling a complete crop management system to be deployed and validated. Such architecture includes modules developed by using Google App Engine, which allows the information to be easily retrieved and processed and agricultural tasks to be properly defined and planned. Additionally, Google’s Datastore (which ensures a high scalability degree), hosts both information that describes such agricultural tasks and agronomic data. The architecture has been validated in a system that comprises a wireless sensor network with fixed nodes and a mobile node on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), deployed in an agricultural farm in the Region of Murcia (Spain). Such a network allows soil water and plant status to be monitored. The UAV (capable of executing missions defined by an administrator) is useful for acquiring visual information in an autonomous manner (under operator supervision, if needed). The system performance has been analysed and results that demonstrate the benefits of using the proposed architecture are detailed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cloud computing; UAVs; WSNs","Murcia [Spain]; Spain; agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural technology; automation; data management; performance assessment; planning method; precision agriculture; sensor; software; trend analysis; unmanned vehicle","","","","","RIDEFRUT, (AGL2013-49047-C2-1-R); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (TIN2013-45920-R)","The development of this work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the projects cDrone (ref.

Now-a-days, industries are proliferately demanding process automation in all fields. Automation culminates into better standard, enhanced production and decreased capital. The fusion of Geographical Information System (GIS) and IOT will bring a dynamic change in the production sector and agro-economy. 'Internet of Things' (IoT) technology is one of those approaches, where using the standard internet protocol, desired technology can transfer wirelessly the data obtained by digitizing the data of the object or the domain of the adapter that it is adapting to the server. This paper presents a low-cost and flexible solution to control and monitor agricultural tools, basically a DC driven Appliance for irrigation or for any other purpose, using Smart Plug devices. The Smart Plug is a power switch which can be accessed via WiFi or any similar communication protocol. This work presents the development of a Smart Plug with a wireless IoT Module. The proposed smart plug has the characteristics of simple design, low cost, easy to transfer the data to any place with the help of MQTT Protocol which is easy to use and easy to control. The foremost concept used here is that continuous control of DC Motor, is carried out using H-Bridge circuit using Power IGBT. Here basically the DC Appliance is chosen because there are only handful methods of parametric control and that the proposed method is reliable and can even work with the smallest step possible. Furthermore, GIS is used in getting the localised satellite data of the farmland and with the help various on-field sensors and local data management unit, it can pass on to the field so that one can yield maximum production and profit from a piece of land. © 2019 IEEE.","Automation; GIS; IOT; MQTT; Smart-Plug","Agricultural implements; Agriculture; Automation; Bridge circuits; Costs; DC motors; Geographic information systems; HVDC power transmission; Information management; Wi-Fi; Continuous control; Control and monitor; H bridge circuits; MQTT; Parametric control; Process automation; Smart agricultures; Smart plugs; Internet of things","","","","","","","Ganu T., Seetharam D.P., Arya V., Kunnath R., Nplug: A smart plug for alleviating peak loads, IBM, White Paper, pp. 01-10, (2012); Song X., Design of smart home system based on power line communication technology and wireless sensor networks, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 51, pp. 757-762, (2016); Fernandez T.M., Carames, An intelligent power outlet system for the smart home of the internet of things, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, Hindawi Publishing Corporation, 2015, pp. 1-11, (2015); Novoa O.B., Fernandez Carames T.M., Lamas P.F., Castedo L., An electricity price-aware open-source smart socket for the internet of energy, Sensors Journal, 17, (2017); Faria R.P., Ramirez V.C., Moura P.S., Moreno J.I., Delgado J.B., Anibal T., Smartplug: Using smart devices for a managed charge of electric vehicles, International Conference on Energy Efficiency in Domestic Appliances and Lighting, (2013); Padmanaban S.K., Ozsoy E., Fedak V., Blaabjerg F., Development of sliding mode controller for a modified boost buck converter configuration, Energies Journal, 10, (2017); Nagarajan R., Sathishkumar S., Balasubramani K., Boobalan C., Naveen S., Sridhar N., Chopper fed speed control of dc motor using pi controller, IOSR Journal for Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 65-69, (2016); Himmelstoss F A., Ryvkin S., Dc/dc converter for motor drive-concept, design, and feed-forward control, Automatika, 54, pp. 290-298, (2013); Qiao Y., Guo J.Y., Wireless dc motor speed control, Senior Design Proposal, (2012); Giridhar M., Kayalvizhi S., Iot based industrial smart grid monitoring using mqtt protocol, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 118, 22, pp. 41-49, (2018); Tsai C.H., Bai Y.W., Chu C.A., Chung C.Y., Lin M.B., Design and implementation of a socket with zero standby power using a photovoltaic array, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 56, 4, pp. 2686-2693, (2010); Kim W.H., Lee S., Hwang J., Real-time energy monitoring and controlling system based on zigbee sensor networks, Elsevier Ltd., 5, pp. 794-797, (2011); Yan W., Wang D., Jia P., Lica W., The PWM speed regulation of dc motor based on intelligent control, Elsevier Ltd., 3, pp. 259-267, (2012); Galioto G., Galioto N., Giaconia C., Giarre L., Neglia G., Tinnirello I., Smart Plugs: A Low Cost Solution for Programmable Control of Domestic Loads, (2014); Balijepalli V.S.K.M., Pradhan V., Khaparde S.A., Review of demand response under smart grid paradigm, IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, (2011); Balijepalli V., Pradhan V., Khaparde S., Shereef R.M., Review of demand response under smart grid paradigm, Innovative Smart Grid Technologies-India (ISGT India), 2011 IEEE PES, pp. 236-243, (2011); Hsu Y.Y., Su C.C., Dispatch of direct load control using dynamic programming, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 6, 3, pp. 1056-1061, (1991); Sheble G.B., Ng K.H., Direct load control-A profit-based load management using linear programming, 13, 2, pp. 668-694, (1998); Buildings Energy Data Book; Hammerstrom D.J., Pacific Northwest Gridwise Testbed Demonstration Projects Part II.

Data practices are a concern for many researchers with new governmental funding mandates that require data management plans, and for the institution providing resources to comply with these mandates. The survey attempted to answer these questions: What are the characteristics of the data held by respondents? What tools do the respondents use in managing, analyzing, or manipulating their data? Where do students primarily learn research data management skills? The survey documents that there is a statistically significant difference in data holding sizes between faculty and graduate students, and that MS-Excel is still the analysis tool of choice. Results also showed that many researchers in the College were not thinking of the Libraries as a resource for data management practices, preservation, or data literacy instruction for graduate students. The survey results may inform the Libraries in developing new data services and instruction, while also highlighting the need for additional research into data practices for specific disciplinary areas or types of researchers. © 2016, Association of College and Research Libraries.

This work aimed to design and develop a control system using node sensors in the crop field with data management via smartphone and a web application. The three components are hardware, web application, and mobile application. The first component was designed and implemented in control box hardware connected to collect data on the crops. Soil moisture sensors are used to monitor the field, connecting to the control box. The second component is a web-based application that was designed and implemented to manipulate the details of crop data and field information. This component applied data mining to analyze the data for predicting suitable temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for optimal future management of crops growth. The final component is mainly used to control crop watering through a mobile application in a smartphone. This allows either automatic or manual control by the user. The automatic control uses data from soil moisture sensors for watering. However, the user can opt for manual control of watering the crops in the functional control mode. The system can send notifications through LINE API for the LINE application. The system was implemented and tested in Makhamtia District, Suratthani Province, Thailand. The results showed the implementation to be useful in agriculture. The moisture content of the soil was maintained appropriately for vegetable growth, reducing costs and increasing agricultural productivity. Moreover, this work represents driving agriculture through digital innovation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture data analysis; Data mining; IoTs; Knowledge discovery; Smart farm; Wireless sensor networks","Thailand; Application programming interfaces (API); Automation; Crops; Data handling; Data mining; Hardware; Information management; Manual control; Mobile computing; Moisture control; Moisture meters; Productivity; Smartphones; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Wireless sensor networks; Agricultural productivity; Agriculture data; Digital innovations; IoTs; Mobile applications; Smart farms; Soil moisture sensors; Web-based applications; agricultural production; control system; crop plant; data acquisition; data envelopment analysis; data management; data mining; hardware; knowledge; mobile phone; moisture content; sensor; vegetable; Internet of things","","","","","Research and Development Office; Prince of Songkla University, PSU","The authors are deeply grateful to the Faculty of Science and Industrial Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Surat Thani campus, Thailand.

The establishment of integrated network platform was mainly on account of the following points. Firstly, communication protocol for collected data was carried out to standardize data formats of different monitoring terminals in view of data characteristics of heterogeneous network. Secondly, standardized data management interface was set up based on XML (extensible markup language) and VB (Visual Basic) 6.0. could parse data and store data from different monitoring terminals according to standard format of communication protocol. Thirdly, remote-monitoring platform was designed and built on the basis of PHP (hypertext preprocessor) language, MySQL (microsoft structure quest language) database, as well as server and website technology. Monitoring system consists of 3 parts: information monitoring terminals, data interface and network platform. Information monitoring terminals collect information of sensors and process original data preliminarily. In the meantime, monitoring terminals are supposed to integrate data according to communication protocol and send data to server. Data management interface is the core of concentrated processing of monitoring data and heterogeneous network data interaction. It is the bridge between monitoring terminals and server database and is tied to communication server. Moreover, its main task is to parse data and transform data by formulas from XML file. Network platform is used to display data and import some setting information. It is a connection channel between monitoring system and clients. Field test was conducted in Yanqing County, Beijing on May 18th, 2016. The test utilized trench depth and position during operation of trencher as monitoring targets. The purpose of test is to verify whether the accuracy of collected data and real-time capacity of data transmission can meet the requirement. In the field test, monitoring terminal collected original data from sensors and integrated data according to the standard format of communication protocol after preliminary treatment. Angle difference and longitude and latitude data were taken as channel data and sent to server interface. Angle difference was channel data monitored, whereas data that needed to be displayed was trench depth. As a result, angle difference needed to be transformed to trench depth by their correlation. The correlation was written to XML file in the form of formula. Data management interface parsed data, calculated trench depth through the formula and stored processed channel data to corresponding sheet in MySQL database. Network platform could invoke trench depth, longitude and latitude in the database. Trench depth could be displayed by means of graphs and tables and from graphs and tables it could be exported to Excel. Longitude and latitude were used to track trencher from platform. The test showed that data management interface could receive and parse data from monitoring terminal in real time, platform could display monitoring data accurately and position track was precise. We can conclude that this research solves problems on heterogeneous network and terminal hardware difference of monitoring system and realizes remote real-time monitoring and remote control of agricultural machinery information. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

One key aspect to optimize agricultural processes and decision making is to derive effective means to acquire and share information along the value chain. In the past, data management in agriculture was dominated by proprietary, mostly Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) driven solutions with limited scope. To overcome the shortcomings associated with this, the German national joint research project iGreen was initiated in 2009 to enable convenient and efficient data sharing in a holistic and OEM independent way. As a project partner, John Deere focused on developing concepts and components for interconnecting machines among each other and with infrastructure nodes. In this paper the achieved results such as the infrastructure component referred to as the machine connector, the onboard data management and integration of mobile devices will be presented and evaluated through experiments focusing on data sharing in wheat and forage harvesting. The overall promising results indicate that in the future new applications focusing on optimizing processes can be enabled that will greatly improve the effectiveness and ease of agricultural production, especially fleet management and resource planning. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ag data management; ISO 11783/ISOBUS; M2I; M2M; OEM independent; Private/public data sharing","Triticum aestivum; Electronic data interchange; Fleet operations; Information management; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Data Sharing; ISO 11783/ISOBUS; M2I; M2M; OEM independent; agricultural production; data inversion; data management; decision making; energy efficiency; food supply; forage; infrastructural development; machinery; optimization; precision agriculture; resource development; wheat; Agriculture","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01 IA08005 P)","This work was partly funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the context of the project iGreen (No. 01 IA08005 P).","Auernhammer H., Speckmann H., Communication issues and internet use: dedicated communication systems and standards for agricultural applications., 4, (2006); Bartolein C., Blank S., Meyer A., Kormann G., Seamless machine data management for agricultural vehicles within the iGreen infrastructure., pp. 293-298, (2011); Bernardi A., Tuot C., Raum-Zeit-Bezogene Agrardaten für die Anforderungen von Morgen: Semantische Datenspeicherung in dezentralen, offenen Architekturen., pp. 33-36, (2011); Blank S., (2012); Blank S., Fohst T., Berns K., A biologically motivated approach towards modular and robust low-level sensor fusion for application in agricultural machinery design, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 89, pp. 10-17, (2012); (2009); Fountas S., Pedersen S., Blackmore S., (2006); Hill C.J., Garrett P.J.K., (2011); International Organization for Standardization, (2007); International Organization for Standardization, (2011); International Organization for Standardization, (2011); Meyer H., Rusch C., Ostermeier R., Landwirtschaftliches, selbstkonfigurierendes Kommunikationssystem zur Überwachung, Optimierung und Dokumentation von Ernteprozessen., pp. 245-250, (2010); Nash E., Korduan P., Bill R., Applications of open geospatial web services in precision agriculture: a review, Precision Agriculture, 10, 6, pp. 546-560, (2009); Rostanin O., Meyer A., Bernardi A., Kormann G., iGreen machine connector: exchanging vehicle status and job infromation data in a dynamic field environment., pp. 527-536, (2012); Society of Automotive Engineers,, (2003); Sawaji O., Intelligence on the road., pp. 12-13, (2012); Steinberger G., Rothmund M., Auernhammer H., Mobile farm equipment as a data source in an agricultural service architecture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 65, 2, pp. 238-246, (2009)","S.

Basis for the method is an empirical study on water use in irrigated agriculture in the Khorezm region. The boundaries of agricultural fields are used to link physiographic land characteristics such as proximity to the Amudarya river, land elevation etc. to survey answers of farmers, thereby explaining patterns of water access and water-saving practices. The results are based on (1) a statistical analysis across three water user associations (WUAs) and (2) visual observations within WUAs. The statistical analysis shows that proximity to the river influences water access and water-saving practices. One WUA thereby represents a specific tail-end situation within Khorezm's irrigation system with an exceptional prevalence of water-saving practices. In the visual ana-lysis, the location of farms within the WUA and the land elevation are used to explain patterns of the survey answers. Despite data and method constraints and despite sometimes contrasting results from the statistical and visual analyses, it is concluded that the method has three advantages as compared to disciplinary, non-spatial approaches: (1) interdisciplinary data management is possible, including the identification of data gaps and consistency checks, (2) immediate data visualization facilitates quick monitoring of research processes and delivers starting points for disciplinary in-depth analyses, and (3) interdisciplinary data integration allows for truly socio-physical analyses. The analytical depth reached in the empirical study is thereby primarily a result of the quality and quantity of the collected data. Considerations concerning the protection of informants determine which kind of analyses can be conducted and published. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Geographic information system (GIS); Interdisciplinary research; Socio-physical analysis; Water access; Water-saving","","","","","","","","Buenemann M., Martius C., Jones J.W., Herrmann S.M., Klein D., Mulligan M., Reed M.S., Winslow M., Washington-Allen R.A., Lal R., Ojima D., Integrative geospatial approaches for the comprehensive monitoring and assessment of land management sustainability: Rationale, potentials, and characteristics, Land Degrad Dev, 21, pp. 1-14, (2011); Conrad C., Remote Sensing Based Modeling and Hydrological Measurements to Assess the Agricultural Water Use in the Khorezm Region, Uzbekistan, (2006); Forkutsa I., Sommer R., Shirokova Y.I., Lamers J.P.A., Kienzler K., Tischbein B., Martius C., Vlek P.L.G., Modelling irrigated cotton with shallow groundwater in the Aral Sea Basin of Uzbekistan: I.

First, this paper illustrate various application scenarios, the IoT supporting domains including resource management, Education, Agriculture, Health care, water quality, natural disasters, transportation, security, automobile, supply chain management, smart cities, Automated metering and monitoring of utilities, waste management, Oil & Gas, security and privacy, energy management. Future, IoT enabling ubiquitous connectivity will cause a faster enhance of data traffic load in both wired and wireless communication networks. The data will be both homogeneous and heterogeneous and the issue arises due to interoperability, Scalability and the middleware Architecture of the IoT systems. We have also discussed about the Issues and Challenges that were faced in the Internet of Things system. We have given an proposed Data Management and Security (DMS) Architecture for IoT system to face challenges like creating ontology's and defining data models are not enough, so data selection refining noisy data from the database through data clustering and selection method through the existing algorithms has to be done. Also, the Security of the Internet of Things systems has been discussed, to overcome some of the Issues and Challenges in Privacy and Security. © International Science Press.","Artificial intelligence;

With the mobility and computability, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) provides a new way for agricultural information collection to solve the above problems. Thus a PDA-based Record-keeping and Decision-support System (PRDS) for traceability in cucumber production was developed on Windows Mobile platform invoking a Geographic Information System (GIS) control. For improving the decision making feasibility of PRDS, the fertilization recommendation model and pesticide usage early warning model were developed by using the Technical Specification of Balanced Fertilization by Soil Testing and the Guideline for Safety Application of Pesticides in China. The architecture of PRDS was provided. With Unified Modeling Language (UML), a requirement model including two types of users and 17 use cases was described, and a static class model was also designed, which consisted of table class, table operation class, algorithm class and interface class. Based on these models, the functions of system setup, map management, data management, production record-keeping and decision-support and query, etc., were implemented by adopting Hosting MapInfo MapX Mobile Controls on the .NET Compact Framework 2.0, and the data synchronization was realized by Remote Data Access (RDA). Two agricultural production enterprises were chosen as case study to evaluate the system by questionnaires. The results show that the efficiency of production record-keeping and decision-support is improved by the simple and friendly system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For this data to be effectively used, it must be transferred between different hardware, software and organisations. These data flows currently present a hurdle to uptake of precision agriculture as the multitude of data models, formats, interfaces and reference systems in use result in incompatibilities. This paper presents work on applying standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium and related initiatives to automate agricultural data processing. The selected use-cases demonstrate how such standards may be used to improve the inter-operability of data and software in precision agriculture. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Automation; Data management; Standardisation; Web services; Workflows","","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (0330663)","Acknowledgments This work was carried out through sub-project ‘‘Spatial Data Infrastructures for Precision Farming’’ of pre agro, which was a collaborative research project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant reference number 0330663.

A PDA was customized by integrating ZigBee coordinator module, GPRS module, GPS OEM module, and RFID module. An embedded orchard farming information application was developed including five modules which are GPS management, Orchard boundary obtaining, Map management, Orchard data collecting, and Uploading and downloading, and it can collect the data from the wireless sensors network, acquire GPS data of each tree, read the RFID card which is mounted on each tree and upload all the collected data to the server via GPRS. An orchard farming service system with a WebGIS module based on MapXtreme component was developed. The WebGIS module includes four sub modules which are Map management, Data communication, Data management, and Data processing. Based on WebGIS, the orchard GIS data can be browsed, queried, processed, calculated, and visualized by using the client browser without installing any extra software. The system test run shows that the system is robust, reliable and operable, and it can provide convenient and quick services for fixed and mobile terminals to achieve remote orchard farming management.","Farming management; Internet; Orchard; WebGIS; Wireless sensors network","Communication; Data Processing; Forestry; GIS; Internet; Orchards; Sensors; Telecommunications; Malus x domestica; Data acquisition; Forestry; Internet; Orchards; Sensors; Telecommunication systems; Trees (mathematics); Wireless networks; Zigbee; Data-communication; Environmental data; Farming management; Information applications; Mobile terminal; Web-GIS; Wireless sensors networks; Zigbee coordinators; Information management","","","","","","","Adamchuk V.I., Hummel J.W., Morgan M.T., Upadhyaya S.K., On-the-go soil sensors for precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 44, 1, pp. 71-91, (2004); Che Y.S., Development of Intelligent Field Information Collection Device Based on PDA., (2011); Cui L.G., Feng G.C., The current situation analysis and development strategies of fruit trees in Wen'an county, Xiandai Nongcun Keji, 39, 9, (2011); Deng X.F., Study on Farmland Information Management System Integrated with GSM Wireless Communication and a Web-based GIS., (2006); Deng X.L., Research and Development of a Wireless Field Sensor Network Based on ZigBee., (2010); Han S.Y., Discussion on the current situation and development of fruit trees planting in Pudong New Area, Shanghai Agricultural Science and Technology, 34, 3, pp. 71-72, (2005); Hu Z.D., Sun L.D., Kuai Z.Z., Li J.F., Discussion on the significance, current situation and development strategies of protected fruit trees cultivation in Northern China, Northern Horticulture, 28, 5, pp. 12-13, (2005); Li M.Z., The characteristics, present situation and development of precision agriculture, Agricultural Machinery Market, 20, 3, pp. 38-41, (2008); Wu X.C., Guo L.L., Bai Y.Q., Developing techniques analysis and implementation of WebGIS, Computer Engineering and Applications, 37, 5, pp. 96-99, (2001); Yang A.J., Shen Y.X., Jin D.N., Wang M., Zhang W., Lu J.Z., He Y., Based on wireless sensor network digital information acquisition and orchard management system, Agricultural Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 37-41, (2011); Zhang X.H., Zhang C.L., Fang J.L., Yu X., Liang J.Q., Smart Sensor nodes for wireless soil temperature monitoring systems in precision agriculture, Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 40, S1, pp. 237-240, (2009); Zhang X.-J., Li M.-Z., Cui D., Zhao P., Sun J.-Y., Tang N., New method and instrument to diagnose crop growth status in greenhouse based on spectroscopy, Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi/Spectroscopy and Spectral Analysis, 26, 5, pp. 887-890, (2006); Zhao C.J., Xue X.Z., Wang X., Chen L.P., Pan Y.C., Meng Z.J., Advance and prospects of precision agriculture technology system, Transactions of the CSAE, 19, 4, pp. 7-12, (2003); Zheng L.H., Li M.Z., Wu C.C., Ye H.J., Ji R.H., Deng X.L., Che Y.S., Fu C., Guo W., Development of a smart mobile farming service system, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 54, 3-4, pp. 1194-1203, (2011)","M.

The gathered data is often used and analyzed by e-research scientists other than the original investigator. Therefore, the sensed data needs to be captured, processed and stored in a form that will allow someone to use the data with confidence long after the original investigators have left the scene. To address this need, in this paper we present SensorFeed, which integrates metadata repositories and sensor data management systems. Using SensorFeed, scientists can annotate sensor readings automatically as they are streamed, through direct use of statistical modeling frameworks. These annotations enrich sensor readings, thus making datasets generated from sensor network deployments usable by external scientists. A real-world use case of SensorFeed for agriculture engineering is presented to show the applicability of our approach to an e-research application. © 2010 IEEE.","","Data processing; Intelligent control; Metadata; Sensor networks; Smart sensors; Agriculture engineering; Application domains; Data sets; Direct use; E-research; Metadata repositories; Model-based; Network deployment; Real-world; Sensor data management; Sensor readings; Statistical modeling; Information management","","","","","","","Abadi D.J., Carney D., Cetintemel U., Cherniack M., Convey C., Lee S., Stonebraker M., Tatbul N., Zdonik S., Aurora: A new model and architecture for data stream management, VLDB Journal, 12, 2, pp. 120-139, (2003); Aberer K., Hauswirth M., Salehi A., Infrastructure for data processing in large-scale interconnected sensor networks, Proc.

Through mobile technologies, farmers are aided to quickly and easily communicate, advertise goods and services, as well as accessing agronomic data in soft-real time. Though mobile devices are a good source of agronomic information access and dissemination, the over-dependence on wireless communication protocols for communication is a bit of a challenge. Due to the mobility of farmers, the wireless networks can experience bandwidth fluctuations and that can hamper data transfer and management in mobile-server (cloud) ecosystems. To address this issue, previous works propose mobile data storage to support information access in an offline mode. However, the question of how to efficiently management the data state on the mobile is under-studied. In this work, we proposed a mobile-cloud architecture that enables farmers to manage data transfer and storage of agronomic data on their mobile devices in the face of the network challenges. Three different P2P Key-Value Storage methodologies are presented which are: 1) Bloom Filters algorithm, 2) whole state data transfer, and 3) exchange of delta (updates) only. The whole state data transfer is only recommended when there is stable wireless connection. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Mobile devices; NoSQL; REST; Synchronization; Web services","Agriculture; Agronomy; Cloud computing; Data transfer; Digital storage; Information retrieval; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Synchronization; Web services; Wireless telecommunication systems; Agriculture sectors; Bandwidth fluctuations; Key-value storages; Mobile data storage; NoSQL; REST; Wireless communication protocols; Wireless connection; Information management","","","","","","","Meads A., Roughton A., Warren I., Weerasinghe T., Mobile service provisioning middleware for multihomed devices, Proceeding WIMOB'09, Networking and Communications, (2009); Pritchett D., BASE: An Acid Alternative partitioned databases, trading some consistency for availability can lead to dramatic improvements in scalability, Queue, 6, 3, pp. 48-55, (2008); Sheng Q.Z., Benatallah B., Maamar Z., Dumas M., Ngu A.H.H., Enabling personalized composition and adaptive provisioning of web services, Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering 2004, LNCS 3084, 2004, pp. 322-337, (2004); Hori M., Kawashima E., Yamazaki T., Application of cloud computing to agriculture and propects in other fields, FUJITSU Sci.

However, GIS data sources and processes preclude participation of non-technology experts who may have crucial environmental information to share. This paper is about a study in using participatory methods in what usually is an expert-dependent use of GIS. It hinges on the technology's integrative spatial analysis capability and people's intimate knowledge of their own space. The case study details how isolated rural farmers of Ifugao, Northern Philippines engaged in collectively interpreting aerial-photographs and satellite images, and tracing their successful tradition in terraced agriculture. In the process, a different side of GIS is shown-from mapping and data management to that of jointly constructing and understanding the 'world' to be managed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SDSS use spatial database systems and Geographical Information Systems as their data management and analysis components in order to get and handle the needed spatial data and perform recommendations, estimations, or predictions. For instance, farmers want to know what the best areas of their farmland are to grow a specific crop. In most cases, the extent and the properties of the spatial phenomena of interest are vague and imprecise. They can be adequately represented by fuzzy spatial objects (e.g., fuzzy points, fuzzy lines, fuzzy regions). In this paper, we formally propose a model named Fuzzy Inference on Fuzzy Spatial Objects (FIFUS), which infers recommendations, estimations, and predictions based on fuzzy rules and knowledge of domain specialists. It incorporates fuzzy spatial objects into the components of the existing fuzzy inference methods in order to take into account the spatial imprecision found in the real world. As a main advantage, FIFUS is a general-purpose model and can thus be applied in many geoscience applications. © 2015 ACM.","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy spatial objects; Spatial decision support system; Spatial fuzziness","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Geology; Information management; Information systems; Query languages; Fuzzy inference method; Fuzzy inference model; Fuzzy spatial objects; Geoscience applications; Spatial database systems; Spatial databases and GIS; Spatial decision support systems; Spatial fuzziness; Fuzzy inference","","","","","","","Calzada A., Liu J., Wang H., Kashyap A., A GIS-based spatial decision support tool based on extended belief rule-based inference methodology, 4th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Management and Decision Support, pp. 388-395, (2013); Jadidi A., Mostafavi M.A., Bedard Y., Shahriari K., Spatial representation of coastal risk: A fuzzy approach to deal with uncertainty, ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 3, 3, pp. 1077-1100, (2014); Jang J.-S., Fuzzy inference systems, Neuro-Fuzzy and Soft Computing: A Computational Approach to Learning and Machine Intelligence, pp. 73-91, (1997); Jasiewicz J., A new GRASS GIS fuzzy inference system for massive data analysis, Computers and Geosciences, 37, 9, pp. 1525-1531, (2011); Schneider M., Fuzzy spatial data types for spatial uncertainty management in databases, Handbook of Research on Fuzzy Information Processing in Databases, pp. 490-515, (2008); Tang X., Spatial Object Modeling in Fuzzy Topological Spaces with Applications to Land Cover Change, (2004); Zadeh L.A., Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-3, 1, pp. 28-44, (1973)","","Huang Y.; Ali M.; Sankaranarayanan J.; Renz M.; Gertz M.","Association for Computing Machinery","Esri; Facebook; Google; Microsoft; NVIDIA","23rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2015","3 November 2015 through 6 November 2015","Seattle","119344","","978-145033967-4","","","English","GIS Proc.

In order to keep more ""detailed"" data available for longer periods, ""old"" data has to be reduced gradually to save space and improve query performance, especially on resource-constrained systems with limited storage and query processing capabilities. A number of data reduction solutions have been developed, however an effective solution particularly based on gradual data reduction is missing. This paper presents an effective solution for data reduction based on gradual granular data aggregation. With the gradual granular data aggregation mechanism, older data can be made coarse-grained while keeping the newest data fine-grained. For instance, when data is 3 months old aggregate to 1 minute level from 1 second level, when data is 6 months old aggregate to 2 minutes level from 1 minute level and so on. The proposed solution introduces a time granularity based data structure, namely a relational time granularity table that enables long term storage of old data by maintaining it at different levels of granularity and effective query processing due to a reduction in data volume. In addition, the paper describes the implementation strategy derived from a farming case study using standard technologies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","data aggregation; Data reduction; gradual granular data aggregation; multi-granular data","Data structures; Information systems; Query processing; Statistics; Coarse-grained; Data aggregation; Data management; Data volume; Effective solution; Implementation strategies; Large amounts of data; Limited storage; Long-term storage; multi-granular data; Number of datum; Processing capability; Query performance; Resource-constrained; Second level; Standard technology; Time granularities; Data reduction","","","","","","","Skyt J., Jensen C.S., Pedersen T.B., Specification-based data reduction in dimensional data warehouses, Information Systems, 33, 1, pp. 36-63, (2008); LandIT; Lopez I.F.V., Moon B., Snodgrass R.T., Spatiotemporal Aggregate Computation: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 2, pp. 271-286, (2005); Li J., Srivastava J., Efficient Aggregation Algorithms for Compressed Data Warehouses, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 14, 3, pp. 515-529, (2002); Rasheed F., Lee Y.K., Lee S., Towards using Data Aggregation Techniques in Ubiquitous Computing Environments, 4th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops, pp. 369-392, (2006); Schulze C., Spilke J., Lehner W., Data Modeling for Precision Dairy Farming within the Competitive Field of Operational and Analytical Tasks, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 59, 1-2, pp. 39-55, (2007); Zhang D., Gunopulos D., Tsotras V.J., Seeger B., Temporal and Spatio-Temporal Aggregations over Data Streams using Multiple Time Granularities, Information Systems, 28, 1-2, pp. 61-84, (2003); Boly A., Hebrail G., Goutier S., Forgetting Data Intelligently in Data Warehouses, IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future, pp. 220-227, (2007); Iftikhar N., Integration, Aggregation and Exchange of Farming Device Data: A High Level Perspective, 2nd IEEE Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies, pp. 14-19, (2009)","N.

In order to obtain measurement data with high selectivities, image-based sensors for noise reduction are necessary, where data management as well as the development of intelligent algorithms are major tasks. The correlation of a single sensor to a single crop parameter does not make sense, a clear separation of raw data, the interpretation and the subsequent development of instructions is necessary. From a technological point of view new sensor and system technologies have a high potential for supporting solutions for the practice, in particular sensor data fusion and simulation technologies.","Field robots; Phenotyping platforms; Sensor fusion; Sensor systems","alternative agriculture; automation; boundary condition; data management; farming system; noise; simulation","","","","","","","Busemeyer L., Klose R., Linz A., Thiel M., Wunder E., Tilenac M., Ruckelshausen A., Agro-sensor systems for outdoor plant phenotyping platforms in low and high densitiy crop field plots, Proceedings 68th International Conference Agricultural Engineering, pp. 213-218, (2010); Cassmann K.G., Global food security, yield limits, precision agriculture, conservation of natural resources and environmental quality, Proceedings 10th International Conference On Precision Agriculture ICPA, (2010); Erdle K., Mistele B., Schmidhalter U., Comparison of active and passive spectral sensors in discriminating biomass parameters and nitrogen status in wheat cultivars, Field Crop Res, 124, pp. 74-84, (2011); Erdle K., Mistele B., Schmidhalte U., Konkurrenz für's Surfbrett-Sensorenvergleich.dlz agrarmagazin, März, pp. 28-34, (2012); Griepentrog H.-W., Ruckelshausen A., Jorgensen R.N., Lund I., Autonomous systems for plant protection, Precision Crop Protection-the Challenge and Use of Heterogeneity, pp. 323-334, (2010); Klose R., Scholz C., Ruckelshausen A., 3D Time-of-Flight camera-based sensor system for automatic crop height monitoring for plant phenotyping, Proceedings CIGR-AgEng 2012 Conference, Automation Technology For Off-Road Equipment, pp. 55-60, (2012); Krombholz K., Soucek R., Die Landtechnik auf dem Weg zur Wissenschaft, Jahrbuch Agrartechnik 2011, (2012); Mitchell H.B., Multi-Sensor Data Fusion, (2007); Poorter H., Niinemets U., Walter A., Fiorani F., Schurr U., A method to construct dose-response curves for a wide range of environmental factors and plant traits by means of a meta-analysis of phenotypic data, Journal of Experimental Botany, 61, 8, pp. 2043-2055, (2010); Rahe F., Heitmeyer K., Biber P., Weiss U., Ruckelshausen A., Gremmes H., Klose R., Thiel M., Trautz D., First field experiments with the autonomous field scout BoniRob, Proceedings 68th International Conference Agricultural Engineering, pp. 419-424, (2010); Ruckelshausen A., Dzinaj T., Gelze F., Kleine H.S., Linz A., Marquering J., Microcontroller-based multisensor system for online crop/weed detection, Proceedings 1999 Brighton Conference, 2, pp. 601-606, (1999); Ruckelshausen A., Busemeyer L., Klose R., Linz A., Moeller K., Thiel M., Alheit K., Rahe F., Trautz D., Weiss U., Sensor and system technology for individual plant crop scouting, Denver/ USA, Proceedings 10th International Conference On Precision Agriculture ICPA, (2010); Tsukor V., Klose R., Ruckelshausen A., Multi-sensor simulation method for outdoor plant phenotyping based on autonomous field robots, Proceedings CIGR-AgEng Conference, (2012); Wagner P., So rechnen sich N-Sensoren-Stickstoffdüngung.dlz agrarmagazin, März, pp. 36-39, (2012); Wunder E., Kielhorn A., Klose R., Thiel M., Ruckelshausen A., GIS- and sensor-based technologies for individual plant agriculture, Landtechnik, 67, 1, pp. 37-41, (2012)","A.

And the transformation and share of data is indispensable to the being-information of agriculture. How to implement data combination, data transformation and data receiving applications are the important means to complete the information share safely and enhance the efficiency. The paper starts with searching of methods to implement data interchange, and introduce some of the methods, points of the techniques, etc. Basing on this, the paper also introduces the detail requirement analyses, system design and detail implementation of the system. According to the requirement and trait of the project, a data interchange system is researched and completed. And a data interchange model based on message-oriented middleware (MOM) is presented in this paper, which builds a middleware between the province and the ministry taking part in data interchange. The system has traits as follows: 1. keeping the data safe and credible while it is transformed. 2. having excellent transplantable and applied capability. 3. doesn't need intervention of workman in the process of data interchange. 4. applying the data interchange between databases of different structure. 5. being simple to be developed and applied. MOM TongLink/Q offers interfaces for application development, and it completes the data transformation through the internet. The integration adapters developed do the data management, which are developed based on the Frame for Applications Integration TongIntegrator. This method offers a new approach to resolve the question of data interchange. Now the system has been successfully applied in the data interchange project of Ministry of Agriculture.","Data exchange; Long-range database; Message oriented middleware; Website","Agriculture; Computer software; Intersections; Management information systems; Method of moments; Middleware; Application development; Applications integration; Data combination; Data exchange; Data interchanges; Data management; Data receiving; Data transformations; Information sharing; Long-range database; Message oriented middleware; Model based; New approaches; System designs; Website; Interchanges","","","","","","","Java, The Complete Reference, (2003); Ming Z., Ma Y., Zhang Xiaoshuan D., WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 6, 12, pp. 1174-1176, (2007); Shim Y.-C., Kang H.-S.N., Sehun Source, Design and application of a middleware for context-aware ubiquitous computing, WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 6, 5, pp. 785-792, (2007); Doblander A., Rinner B., Trenkwalder, A middleware framework for dynamic reconfiguration and component composition in embedded smart cameras, WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 5, 3, pp. 574-581, (2006); Shegalov G., Gillmann M., Weikum G., XML-enabled workflow management for e-services across heterogeneous platforms, VLDB Journal, 10, 1, pp. 91-103, (2001); Tran P., Greenfield P., orton I., Behavior and Performance of Message -oriented Middleware Systems, Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, pp. 645-650, (2002)","X.

The aim of reducing the environmental risk caused by agriculture activities (e.g. nitrogen losses into groundwater and atmosphere) can be only achieved through a critical and scientific analysis of livestock manure management in a whole-farm perspective. Keeping in mind this objective, the decision support system (DSS) ValorE was developed. It can be described as a tool able to evaluate from the environmental, technical, agronomic and economic points of view the main components of manure management (production, storage, treatment and land application) for a variety of livestock types (i.e., cattle, swine, poultry, sheep, goats and horses), under different scenarios adopted at farm and territorial scale. ValorE consists of three main components: data management subsystem, model management subsystem and two versions of user-interface, both for farm and territorial scale. Most of the inputs to the DSS comes from external databases, while a software tool developed in the .NET environment and implemented using object oriented programming (C# language), provides the logic to manage the scenario simulation of agronomic and environmental farm-scale models. Users and stakeholders can carry out comparative analysis, starting from the knowledge of the current perspective, in terms of manure management system at farm or territorial scale by interrogating the available databases. Moreover, they can generate different alternative scenarios thanks to different options for the manure handling and cropping system simulation. Then they can finally evaluate and compare different scenarios through multidisciplinary and synthetic indicators but also visualise spatial effects exploiting the coupled webGIS. ValorE is therefore an attempt to offer a comprehensive tool for improving both farm strategy and decision making process, which is particularly important in a very intensive agricultural area, with one of the highest livestock density in the world, as Lombardy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision support system; GIS; Integrated evaluation; Manure management; Multidisciplinary indicators","Italy; Lombardy; Bos; Capra hircus; Equidae; Ovis aries; Suidae; data management; database; decision making; decision support system; environmental risk; GIS; intensive agriculture; livestock farming; manure; software; integrated approach; livestock; planning method; waste management","","","","","CRPA; Catholic University of Piacenza; ERSAF; Free University of Bozen; Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca; Regione Lombardia","We gratefully thank Regione Lombardia and ERSAF for funding the research and successive software development and maintenance, Dr. G.

As part of a research effort to explore this possibility, an experimental system was designed to collect audio, video, temperature, and humidity data for the entire six-week growout cycle of a flock of broiler chickens. The system consists of a Linux-based personal computer platform, two Shure condenser microphones, four video cameras, two temperature sensors, and a relative humidity sensor. A custom software application was developed to manage, record, and compress the data from the sensors, and it includes a graphic user interface where ammonia levels and other activities within the growout house could be logged manually. This paper describes in detail the design, configuration and operation of the integrated system along with considerations for data management and analysis. Overall the design has proven to be robust, and the operation relatively straight forward. Since the research is ongoing, the system continues to be improved for use in future data collection activities.","Animal welfare; Poultry; Video monitoring; Vocalizations","Agriculture; Animals; Computer operating systems; Data acquisition; Information management; Personal computers; Poultry; Sensors; Video cameras; Animal welfare; Audio and video; Broiler chickens; Condenser microphone; Data collection; Environmental conditions; Experimental system; Graphic user interface; Integrated systems; Research efforts; Software applications; Video monitoring; Vocalizations; Data compression","","","","","","","Lavrsen K., Motion; Ryder A.A., Feddes J.J.R., Zuidhof M.J., Field study to relate heat stress index to broiler performance, Journal of Applied Poultry Research, 13, 3, pp. 493-499, (2004); USB Weather Board - SparkFun Electronics; Yanagi T., Xin H., Gates R.S., A Research Facility for Studying Poultry Responses to Heat Stress and its Relief, Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 18, 2, pp. 255-262, (2002)","S.

This paper analyses the potentials and develops general procedures for on-the-go data acquisition of soil sensors. The methods and procedures used to manage data with respect to a farm management information system (FMIS) are described. The current data communication standard for tractors and machinery in agriculture is ISO 11783, which is rather well established and has gained market acceptance. However, there are a significant number of non-ISO 11783 compliant sensors in practice. Thus, two concepts are proposed. The first concept is on-the-go data collection based on ISO 11783, which mostly covers data on parameters related to tractor and machine performance, e.g. speed, draught, fuel consumption, etc. Process data from sensors with Control Area Network (CAN) interfaces is converted into ISO 11783 XML and then imported into relational database at FMIS using RelaXML tool. There is also the export function from database to task controller (TC) to provide task management, as described in ISO 11783:10. The second concept is on-the-go data collection with non-ISO 11783 sensors. This data is likely to be recorded in many formats, which require an import service. An import service is based on local or public sharing or semantic mapping outputting a common format for FMIS (e.g. AgroXML). Import is best performed as close to the generation of sensor data as possible to maximise the availability of metadata. A case study of sensor based variable rate fertilisation (VRF) has been undertaken focussing on German fertilisation rules. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Data management; FMIS; ISO 11783; On-the-go soil sensors","Agriculture; Information management; Knowledge management; Machinery; Metadata; Semantics; Sensors; Soils; Tractors (truck); Common format; Control area network; Current data; Data collection; Fertilisation; FMIS; ISO 11783; Machine performance; Market acceptance; On-the-go soil sensors; Precision Agriculture; Process data; Relational Database; Semantic mapping; Sensor data; Soil sensors; Task management; Variable rate; data acquisition; data management; database; farming system; fertilizer application; fuel consumption; machinery; meta-analysis; precision agriculture; sensor; soil analysis; Data acquisition","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (212117)","This project was part of the Collaborative Research Project FutureFarm .

In order to keep more 'detailed' data available for longer periods, 'old' data has to be reduced gradually to save space and improve query performance, especially on resource-constrained systems with limited storage and query processing capabilities. A number of data reduction solutions have been developed, however an effective solution particularly based on gradual data reduction is missing. This paper presents an effective solution for data reduction based on gradual granular data aggregation. With the gradual granular data aggregation mechanism, older data can be made coarse-grained while keeping the newest data fine-grained. For instance, when data is 3 months old aggregate to 1 minute level from 1 second level, when data is 6 months old aggregate to 2 minutes level from 1 minute level and so on. The proposed solution introduces a time granularity based data structure, namely a relational time granularity table that enables long term storage of old data by maintaining it at different levels of granularity and effective query processing due to a reduction in data volume. In addition, the paper describes the implementation strategy derived from a farming case study using standard database technologies.","Data aggregation; gradual granular data aggregation; multi-dimensional data aggregation; multi-granular data; time granularity","Aggregates; Data reduction; Information management; Query processing; Data aggregation; Granular datum; multi-granular data; Multidimensional data; Time granularities; Digital storage","","","","","","","Boly A., Hebrail G., Goutier S., Forgetting data intelligently in data warehouses, 2007 IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future, RIVF 2007, pp. 220-227, (2007); Cuzzocrea A., Furfaro F., Mazzeo G.M., Sacca D., A Grid framework for approximate aggregate query answering on summarized sensor network readings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3292, pp. 144-153, (2004); Cuzzocrea A., Cams: OLAPing multidimensional data streams efficiently, Proc. 11th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 48-62, (2009); Cuzzocrea A., Retrieving accurate estimates to OLAP queries over uncertain and imprecise multidimentional data streams, Proc. 23rd Scientific and Statistical Database Management Conference, pp. 575-576, (2011); Han J., Chen Y., Dong G., Pei J., Wah B.W., Wang J., Cai Y.D., Scream cube: An architecture for multi-dimensional analysis of data streams, Distributed and Parallel Databases, 18, 2, pp. 173-197, (2005); Iftikhar N., Pedersen T.B., A rule-based tool for gradual granular data aggregation, Proc. 14th ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP, pp. 1-8, (2011); Iftikhar N., Pedersen T.B., Gradual data aggregation in multi-granular fact tables on resource-constrained systems, Proc. 14th International Conference on Knowledge-based Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems, pp. 349-358, (2010); Iftikhar N., Integration, aggregation and exchange of farming device data: A high level perspective, Proc. 2nd IEEE Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies, pp. 14-19, (2009); Iftikhar N., Pedersen T.B., LandIT database : A case study, Proc. 16th European Conference on Information Systems in Agriculture and Forestry, pp. 51-59, (2010); Iftikhar N., Pedersen T.B., Schema design alternatives for multi-granular data warehousing, Proc. 21st International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 111-125, (2010); Iftikhar N., Pedersen T.B., Using a time granularity table for gradual granular data aggregation, Proc. 14th East-European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems, pp. 219-233, (2010); Li J., Srivastava J., Efficient aggregation algorithms for compressed data warehouses, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 14, 3, pp. 515-529, (2002); Lopez I.F.V., Snodgrass R.T., Moon B., Spatiotemporal aggregate computation: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 2, pp. 271-286, (2005); Molina H.G., Ullman J.D., Widom J., Database Systems: The Complete Book, (2002); Osborne K., Johnson R., Poder T., Expert Oracle Exadata, (2011); Pitarch Y., Laurent A., Plantevit M., Poncelet P., Multidimensional data stream summarization using extended tilted-timewindows, Proc.

Due to the huge number of these datasets it is necessary to use data analysis techniques in order to comprehend the data and extract useful information. The purpose of this paper is to measure, archetype and mine olea europaea production data. Design/methodology/approach: This work applies three different data mining techniques to data about Olea europaea var. media oblonga from the island of Thassos, at the northern part of Greece. The data were from 1,063 farmers from three different municipalities of Thassos, namely Kallirachi, Limenaria and Prinos and concerned the year 2010. They were analysed using the classification algorithm OneR, the clustering algorithm k-means and the association rule mining algorithm, Apriori from the WEKA data mining package. Also, new measures which quantify the performance of the productions of olives and oil are applied. Finally, archetypal analysis is applied in order to distinguish the most typical/stereotype farms for each region and describe their specific characteristics. Findings: The results indicate that organic cultivation could improve the production of olives and olive oil. Furthermore, the climate differences among the three municipalities seems to be a factor involved in production efficacy. Originality/value: It is the first time that data from the island of Thassos have been analysed systematically using a variety of data mining methods. Also, the measures proposed in the paper in order to analyse the data are new. Furthermore, archetypal analysis is proposed as a method to extract sterotypes/representative farms from the dataset. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Archetypal analysis; Association rule mining;

These constraints can be modelled using formal languages such as the spatial extension of the Object Constraint Language (Spatial OCL). This language allows the expression of topological integrity constraints involving crisp spatial objects but it does not support constraints involving spatial objects with vague shapes (e.g. forest stand, pollution zone, valley or lake). In this paper, we propose an extension of Spatial OCL based on (1) a geometric model for objects with vague shapes, and (2) an adverbial approach for modelling topological constraints involving regions with broad boundaries. This new language provides an easiness in the formal modelling of these complex constraints. Our approach has been implemented in a code generator. A case study is also presented in the paper in the field of agriculture spreading activities.

Early identification of populations at risk enables timely and appropriate action. Since large and widely dispersed populations depend on rainfed agriculture and pastoralism, climate monitoring and forecasting are important inputs to food security analysis. Satellite rainfall estimates (RFE) fill in gaps in station observations, and serve as input to drought index maps and crop water balance models. Gridded rainfall time-series give historical context, and provide a basis for quantitative interpretation of seasonal precipitation forecasts. RFE are also used to characterize flood hazards, in both simple indices and stream flow models. In the future, many African countries are likely to see negative impacts on subsistence agriculture due to the effects of global warming. Increased climate variability is forecast, with more frequent extreme events. Ethiopia requires special attention. Already facing a food security emergency, troubling persistent dryness has been observed in some areas, associated with a positive trend in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures. Increased African capacity for rainfall observation, forecasting, data management and modelling applications is urgently needed. Managing climate change and increased climate variability require these fundamental technical capacities if creative coping strategies are to be devised. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Africa; Climate; Ethiopia; Food security","Africa South of the Sahara; Climate; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Ethiopia; Food Supply; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Rain; Socioeconomic Factors; Africa; East Africa; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa; rain; climate change; climate forcing; climate prediction; early warning system; extreme event; famine; food security; global warming; pastoralism; rainfall; rainfed agriculture; sea surface temperature; streamflow; subsistence agriculture; weather forecasting; Africa south of the Sahara; catering service; climate; crop; environment; Ethiopia; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; human; review; socioeconomics; standard","","","","","","","Anyamba A., Eastman R., Interannual variability of NDVI over Africa and its relation to El Niño/southern oscillation, Int.

Recent developments and advances in wireless technology as well as affordability give rise to this emerging field in the realm of precision agriculture. The main purpose of this research is to develop an efficient telemetry system for measuring and storing micro-climates and environmental data. The data collected is to be used for building various models that could enhance our understanding about the effects of climate change on grapevine growth and wine quality within major wine regions in several countries being studied in the initial research. We propose a system architecture for wireless sensor networks and a database model for handling and storing sensor data streams in real-time. This architecture utilises Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) located in several vineyards in three continents. It collects data from WSN and continuously transmits physical or environmental conditions at different locations to a remote central data server.

The introduction of information technology and automation in farm fields started in the eighties with the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the subsequent development of Precision Agriculture. While being indispensable for many innovative applications, global positioning is not sufficient for all situations encountered in the field, where local sensing is essential if accurate and updated, information has to control automated vehicles. Safeguarding, high resolution mapping, and real time monitoring can only be achieved with local perception sensors such as cameras, lasers, and sonar rangers. However, machine vision offers multiple advantages over other sensing alternatives, and among imaging sensors, stereo vision provides the richest source of information for real time actuation. This chapter presents an overview of current and future applications of 3D stereo vision to off-road intelligent vehicles, with special emphasis in real problems found in agricultural environments and practical solutions devised to cope with them, as image noise, system configuration, and 3D data management. Several examples of stereo perception engines implemented in robotized off-road vehicles illustrate the concepts introduced along the chapter. © 2012, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Bailey M., Chanler A., Maxwell B., Micire M., Tsui K., Yanco H., Development of vision-based navigation for a robotic wheelchair,  International Conference On Rehabilitation Robotics, pp. 951-957, (2007); Herath D.C., Kodagoda K.R.S., Dissanayake G., Modeling errors in small baseline stereo for SLAM,  International Conference On Control, Automation, Robotics, and Vision, pp. 1-6, (2006); Kato S., Tomita K., Tsugawa S., Visual navigation along reference lines and collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles, Proc.

Advances in telecommunications technologies continue to help make farm life easier and to improve production efficiencies. The convergence of sensing, computing and communication technologies for agricultural applications has led to the creation of a new technology - Agricultural Infotronics Systems (AIS), which is a framework of wirelessly networked on-farm production data management systems to collect, process, and transmit the ""ready-to- use"" site-specific production data to the user on the machinery while performing the field operation. Thus, telecommunication technology is the backbone of precision agriculture. Precision farming involves integrated technologies such as GPS, GIS, remote sensing, and Variable Rate Technology (VRT), crop models, yield monitors and precision irrigation. In brief, precision agriculture refers to tailoring crop and soil management practices according to variation in crop and soil conditions within each field. This paper describes shortly about precision farming and its management.","AIS; Integrated technologies; Precision; Production efficiencies","Agronomy; Crops; Information management; Machinery; Seed; Technology; AIS; Communication technologies; Integrated technologies; Precision; Production data managements; Production efficiency; Telecommunication technologies; Telecommunications technologies; Cultivation","","","","","","","Munack A., Speckmann H., Communication technology is the backbone of precision Agriculture.

In view of the fact that environmental assessments are a relatively new phenomenon, data collection activities targeted toward these needs are not widespread. As a result, we find it necessary to acquire and integrate a variety of data sources with differing time lines, spatial scales and sampling frameworks. This paper uses our current activities with respect to Kyoto reporting as a focus to present and discuss the types of data required and the spatial analysis and integration procedures being developed to provide them. The essential data for this activity include the area of crop and land use types, land use changes since 1990, farm and land management practices and biomass production. The spatial framework selected for national analysis is the Soil Landscapes of Canada, and the primary existing data sources are the Census of Agriculture, sample-derived yield estimates and satellite-based land cover products. These are supplemented with detailed, multi-season, multi-year satellite image interpretations conducted at an ecologically and statistically stratified sample of sites across the country. The use of these data in preparing an account of greenhouse gas sources and sinks identified a number of gaps and problems, and a brief outline of future work designed to improve the data inputs is presented.","Carbon sequestration; Data integration; Greenhouse gases; Kyoto reporting; Land use and management","Canada; North America; agricultural land; agricultural production; biomass; carbon sequestration; data management; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; land management; land use; land use change; landscape","","","","","","","Fisette T., Maloley M., White L., Chenier R., Huffman T., Ogston R., Pacheco A., Gasser P.-Y., Towards a National Agricultural Land Cover Classification - Evaluating a Decision Tree Approach.

By using GFT for managing sensor observations, it is possible to take advantages of benefits of Cloud Computing database, and provide a scalable sensor observation service. A Sensor Observation Service (SOS) can provide real-time or near-real-time observations. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Cloud-based sensor observation service using Cloud Computing database in SOS services. GFT allows time-critical access and visualization of these sensor observations. By storing sensor observations in GFT, the SOS service is scalable and observations can be visualized easily. Challenges of developing applications and approaches on the integration of GFT and SOS are discussed. A prototype service is developed to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.","Cloud Computing; Geospatial Service; Google Fusion Tables; Sensor Observation Service","Agriculture; Cloud computing; Database systems; Information management; Systems engineering; Cloud-based; Computing database; Design and implementations; Geo-spatial services; Google Fusion Tables; Near-real time; Sensor observation services; Time-critical; Sensors","","","","","","","Vaquero L.M., Rodero-Merino L., Caceres J., Lindner M., A break in the clouds: Towards a cloud definition, SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 39, 1, pp. 50-55, (2009); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Definition of Cloud Computing, (2009); Agrawal D., Das S., Abbadi A.E., Big data and cloud computing: Current state and future opportunities, Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, (2011); Stonebraker M., SQL databases v.

It is a rather complicated process as many factors must be controlled in order to produce good and environmentally safe fertigation practices. The efficiency and uniformity of irrigation, as well as the balance of the nutritive solution used to irrigate are highly ruled by the complex and diverse information (weather, soil, water, and crop data). The article presents the rationale and structure of a decision support system (DSS) and of a Fertigation module (FS - Fertigation Simulator). The DSS-FS system is intended to support design and optimization of irrigation and fertigation systems while increasing their environmental sustainability. The data set to be processed is stored in the DSS database and can be continuously updated according to new development results. Afterwards, the user might handle the input data through a basic and user-friendly interface while allowing the DSS-FS to retrieve default scenarios and thereby reducing the systems user's need for advanced knowledge. An advanced mode of DSS-FS, which adds an increased level of precision in exchange for human support, includes soil sample analysis and other relevant information. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support system; Fertigation; Fertigation simulator; Fertigation software; Irrigation; Nutritive solution","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Optimization; Simulators; Data sets; Decision supports; Design and optimization; Development results; Drip irrigation systems; Environmental sustainability; Environmentally safe; Fertigations; Human support; Input datas; Soil sample; Support design; User friendly interface; agricultural soil; agricultural technology; alternative agriculture; computer simulation; data management; database; decision support system; drip irrigation; farmers knowledge; fertilizer application; nutrient; optimization; precision; software; soil analysis; Sprinkler systems (irrigation)","","","","","Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Česká Zemědělská Univerzita v Praze","This study was partly supported by the research programme no.

Those standard geospatial web services can be integrated in scientific workflows to accomplish specific tasks or consumed over the Web to create value-added new geospatial application by users. In addition, this paper demonstrates, via real world use cases, applications of those services and potential impacts on facilitating geospatial Cropland Data Layer (CDL) retrieval, analysis, visualization, dissemination and integration in agricultural industry, government, research, and educational communities. This paper also shows that the geospatial Web service approach helps improve the reusability, interoperability, dissemination, and utilization of agricultural geospatial data.

The system sustains about 1,000 km2 of irrigated crops and supplies groundwater to 275,000 inhabitants. The economic transformation brought about by the development of extensive irrigated cropland has led to a water-balance disequilibrium of about 75 million m3/year. This input-output deficit has negative consequences in the quantity and quality of the available resources, in the river-aquifer relationship, and in the associated ecosystems as well. To understand the hydrogeological behaviour of the system, it is necessary to design a conceptual model. Further, the conceptualisation of a groundwater flow system is a requirement of the European Water Framework Directive for the characterisation of groundwater bodies. The robustness of the conceptual model depends heavily on the user capability of representing the real system. In this work, a multidisciplinary approach has been used to represent the three-dimensional geological framework and the groundwater flow conceptualisation of the MOS. Data management and three-dimensional visualisation have been carried out by means of geographical information system (GIS) tools and software for contouring and three-dimensional surface mapping. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Agriculture; Conceptual models; Geographic information systems; Over-abstraction; Spain","Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; agriculture; aquifer; GIS; groundwater flow; hydrogeology; modeling; visualization","","","","","Albacete City Council; Consejería de Educación y Ciencia de la Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, UCLM; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM","This study is part of the PhD Thesis of D.

Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States","Geographical information systems (GIS) software packages have been used for nearly three decades as analytical tools in natural resource management for geospatial data assembly, processing, storage, and visualization of input data and model output. However, with increasing availability and use of full-featured geospatial data management tools, such as commercial (e.g., ArcGIS and IDRISI) and public domain open source (e.g., GRASS, Quantum GIS, MapWindow, uDIG) GIS, new issues have surfaced regarding application of natural resource models to a range of spatial scales and the role of geospatial data tools and analytical techniques in decision making. With increased availability of powerful PCs, cloud computing platforms, and web-based GIS tools and access to geospatial data sets, it is quite common to see natural resource models originally developed for small-scale, site-specific analyses now being applied to new domains/problems, and, through GIS, to very large areas to examine spatio-temporal variations in environmental impact assessment. This paper provides an overview of the GMI (Geospatial Modeling Interface) simulation framework for natural resource model deployment and evaluation. GMI currently provides access to numerous environmental and agroecosystem models including AgroEcoSystem-Watershed (AgES-W), Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis 2 (NLEAP2), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and Root Zone Water Quality Model 2 (RZWQM2). GMI data processing and visualization features include but are not limited to: (1) editing and visualization of geospatial model input data; (2) the ability to input measured experimental data for robust statistical model evaluation; and (3) geospatial output visualization across space, time, and modeling scenarios including capabilities for real-time post-processing (e.g., on-the-fly color ramping) and querying. GMI leverages the GeoWind open source GIS platform that integrates Open Geospatial Consortium standards (as implemented in GeoTools) within NASA's World Wind Java SDK. The overall vision of the GMI development effort is the creation of a geospatial modeling framework that allows rapid integration of environmental models and enhances enables the scientific modeling process through state-of-the-art visualization components.

Collecting evidence, analyzing it, and using results to draw conclusions are all mutually distinct endeavors. Different physical locations and personnel are involved, juxtaposed against an acute need for security and data integrity. Using digital technologies and the Internet's ubiquity, these diverse elements can be conjoined using digital data as the common element. This result is a new data management process that can be applied to serve all elements of the community. The first step is recognition of a forensics ""lifecycle."" Evidence gathering, analysis, storage, and use in legal proceedings are actually just distinct parts of a single end-to-end process, and thus, it is hypothesized that a single data system that can also accommodate each constituent phase, through the application of common network and security protocols. This paper introduces the idea of web-based Central Data Repository. The backbone element of this system is its ""anywhere, anytime"" Internet upload, viewing, and report distribution capability. Archives exist indefinitely after being created, and high-strength security and encryption protect data and ensure all subsequent case file additions do not violate chain-of-custody or other handling provisions. Several legal precedents have been established for using digital information in courts of law, and in fact, effective prosecution of ""cyber"" crimes absolutely relies on its use. An example is a US Department of Agriculture division's use of digital images to back up inspection processes and enforce the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. Forensics is a cumulative process. Secure, web-based data management solutions, such as the Central Data Repository postulated here, can unify and support each process step. Logically marrying digital technologies with Internet accessibility is intended to nurture a thought process and explore alternatives aimed at making forensics data accessible to authorized individuals, whenever and wherever they need it.","Data integrity; Database; Digital imagery; Encryption; Internet; Lifecycle; Security","Cryptography; Database systems; Image sensors; Information management; Internet; Network protocols; Security of data; Forensic data management; Image processing","","","","","","","Reynolds W.N., An Interview with DNA Forensics Authority Dr. Bruce Weir; The Scam at Hunts Point; Report and Analysis of the Hunts Points Bribery Incident","T.S.

A total of 363 samples from 25 white and red grape varieties were used to construct quality-prediction models based on reference data and on NIR spectral data obtained using a commercially-available diode-array spectrophotometer (380-1,700 nm). The feasibility of testing bunches of intact grapes was investigated and compared with the more traditional must-based method. Two regression approaches (MPLS and LOCAL algorithms) were tested for the quantification of changes in soluble solid content (SSC), reducing sugar content, pH-value, titratable acidity, tartaric acid, malic acid and potassium content. Cross-validation results indicated that NIRS technology provided excellent precision for sugar-related parameters (r2 = 0.94 for SSC and reducing sugar content) and good precision for acidity-related parameters (r2 ranging between 0.73 and 0.87) for the bunch-analysis mode assayed using MPLS regression. At validation level, comparison of LOCAL and MPLS algorithms showed that the non-linear strategy improved the predictive capacity of the models for all study parameters, with particularly good results for acidity-related parameters and potassium content. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bunch analysis; NIR spectroscopy; On-vine; Quality parameters","Agriculture; Algorithms; Calibration; Carbohydrates; Fruit; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Malates; Potassium; Quality Control; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Tartrates; Vitis; carbohydrate; malic acid; malic acid derivative; potassium; tartaric acid; tartaric acid derivative; agriculture; algorithm; article; calibration; chemistry; fruit; methodology; near infrared spectroscopy; pH; physiology; quality control; regression analysis; reproducibility; Vitis","","malic acid, 149-61-1, 6915-15-7; potassium, 7440-09-7; tartaric acid, 133-37-9, 3715-17-1, 526-83-0, 526-94-3, 87-69-4; Carbohydrates, ; Malates, ; Potassium, 7440-09-7; Tartrates, ; malic acid, 6915-15-7; tartaric acid, 526-83-0","","","","","Menesatti P., In-Field Spectrophotometric Measurement to Estimate Maturity Stage of Wine Grapes, Proc.

This research aims to resolve these problems by rebuilding the system with agent technology, and a prototype of the agricultural and forestry economy decision support system (AFEDSS) based on agent is designed and implemented. The AFEDSS is composed of interface agent, management agent, model agent, forecast agent, assistant decision agent, data management agent. The results show that the new system can simulate and deal with the complex processes of agricultural and forestry economies in reasonably short computational times and with less subjective uncertainty.

Aspen is currently declining in western mountains; stressors include conifer expansion due to fire suppression, drought, disease, heavy wildlife and livestock use, and human development. Forecasting of tree species distributions under future climate scenarios predicts severe losses of western aspen within the next 50 years. As a result, aspen has been selected as one of 14 vital signs for long-term monitoring by the National Park Service Upper Columbia Basin Network. This article describes the development of a monitoring protocol for aspen including inventory mapping, selection of sampling locations, statistical considerations, a method for accounting for spatial dependence, field sampling strategies, and data management. We emphasize the importance of collecting pilot data for use in statistical power analysis and semi-variogram analysis prior to protocol implementation. Given the spatial and temporal variability within aspen stem size classes, we recommend implementing permanent plots that are distributed spatially within and among stands. Because of our careful statistical design, we were able to detect change between sampling periods with desired confidence and power. Engaging a protocol development and implementation team with necessary and complementary knowledge and skills is critical for success. Besides the project leader, we engaged field sampling personnel, GIS specialists, statisticians, and a data management specialist.

The data transfer between the monitored field/ site and the headquarters of the operating entity is usually challenging and time consuming for the ordinary farmers. Time spent by waiting for the collected field data to be received at the headquarters of the servicing company may cause multiple delays in the time schedule of the future field operations. Disturbances within the time schedule of the on-going field operations may cause delays for the payment of equipment and raw materials suppliers. Time management solutions currently in place within the production processes such as ""just in time production"", where timetables are crucial for the production cycles, rely on modern technologies and transportation solutions for the completion of the product, while maintaining low storage costs for the raw materials. Within this field, data management and data transportation solutions are a key component in the relevant production cycle. The paper presents a new architecture for a GSM based data transfer system and gives an overlook over its economic feasibility and potential implementation. One can also find within the paper a SWOT analysis of the possible replacement for the current data transfer solution with the GSM based data transfer system.","Data transfer; Feasibility; GSM; Profitability; Remote sensing","Agriculture; Data transfer; Just in time production; Materials handling; Monitoring; Profitability; Remote sensing; Data collection; Data logger; Economic feasibilities; Feasibility; Feasibility analysis; Field data; Field operation; Key component; Low-storage; Modern technologies; Monitoring sensors; Multiple delays; Precision Agriculture; Production cycle; Production process; Research issues; SWOT analysis; Technological operations; Time management; Time schedules; Time spent; Transfer systems; Information management","","","","","","","Cwan L., Jiang J., Lee R., Et al., Feasibility study on application of GSM-SMS technology to field data acquisition, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 53, 1, pp. 45-59, (2006); Azman M., Nasirudin A., Inzarulfaisham R., Preliminary design on the development of wireless sensor network for paddy rice cropping monitoring application in malaysia, European Journal of Scientific Research, 37, 4, pp. 649-657, (2009); Ming L., Jiang-Ping Q., Xin-Ting Y., Chuan-Heung S., Zeng-Tao J., A PDA -based record-keeping and decision-support system for traceability in cucumber production, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 70, 1, pp. 69-77, (2010); Riquelme L., Soto F., Suardiaz J., Sanchez P., Iborra A., Vera J., Wireless Sensor networks for precision horticulture in Southern Spain, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 68, 1, pp. 25-35, (2009); Casademont J., Lopez-Aguilera E., Paradells J., Rojas A., Calveras A., Barcelo F., Cotrina J., Wireless technology applied to GIS, Computers and Geosciences, 30, 6, pp. 671-682, (2004)","C.

DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals - Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Agriculture and animal health parameters are strictly correlated factors and as such they should be considered when analysing pasture behaviours for a certain area with respect to animal diseases. A Geographical Information System (GIS) is a solid tool for the veterinary to manage data and find correlations with its location and spatial extension over time. GIS can lead to novel animal disease distribution models, thus helping in the interpretation of, e.g., an epidemic episode or a groundwater contamination. Contaminated or polluted areas have bad effects on herds insisting on that area and, as a side effect, on products and food connected with both animals and plants on the same area. Moreover, many misbehaviours in human-managed farms higher risks for human health. In mixed farms (i.e. where both animals and vegetable crops are managed) in fact, animal droppings are often used to manure vegetables, thus creating a potential risk for the diffusion of pathogenic micro-organisms polluting deep and superficial groundwater or producing even more serious problems. In this paper we report about the project of using a GIS technology-based tool to monitor the land use of a large agricultural area, where high quality land products and animal based foods (such as milk production or cheese or meat); the idea is to verify whereas high concentration of animals related production, are land related with possible bacteria or problems in agricultural productions. The idea is to use GIS as potential prevention models for studying (i) farms as potential accumulators of pathogens, (ii) the environment (i.e. ground and water) as a collector of pathogens coming from herbs or farms and (iii) contaminated vegetable and crop production as a vehicle of infection for humans. We plan to use a tool implemented as a general purpose geographical information system with querying and spatial data management capabilities. Such a tool, called Geomedica, can be used easily and efficiently to design and implement ad hoc queries. A first set of queries performed over the preliminary dataset were able to validate our models and verify the correctness of our assumptions and to visualize results on a geographical map. © 2012 ACM.","animal diseases; GIS; groundwater contamination","Animals; Contamination; Cultivation; Diseases; Groundwater; Health risks; Information management; Manures; Public health; Risk assessment; Vegetables; Veterinary medicine; Agricultural areas; Agricultural productions; Animal disease; Contaminated vegetables; Design and implements; Groundwater contamination; Pathogenic microorganisms; Spatial data management; Geographic information systems","","","","","","","Rigaux P., Scholl M., Voisard A., Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS, The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems; Guy De Tr., Gloria Bordogna Spatio-Temporal Databases: Flexible Querying and Reasoning; De Berg M., Van Krefeld M., Overmars M., Schwarzkopf O., Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications; Tradigo G., Veltri P., Greco S., Geomedica: Managing and querying clinical data distributions on geographical database systems, Procedia CS, 1, 1, pp. 979-986, (2010); Tradigo G., Cannataro M., Guzzi P.H., Veltri P., Geomedica: A web portal for managing and querying clinical and biological data (Demo Paper), Proceedings of SEBD, pp. 350-353, (2010); Cannataro M., Talia D., Tradigo G., Trunfio P., Veltri P., SIGMCC: A system for sharing meta patient records in a Peer-to-Peer environment, Future Generation Computer Systems, 24, 3, pp. 222-234, (2008); Cannataro M., Tradigo G., Guzzi P.H., Veltri P., Using ontologies for preprocessing and mining spectra data on the Grid, Future Generation Computer Systems, 23, 1, (2007)","","","","Google; Microsoft; ESRI; Nokia; NVIDIA","1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on the Use of GIS in Public Health, HealthGIS 2012 - In Conjunction with the 20th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems","6 November 2012 through 6 November 2012","Redondo Beach, CA","96731","","978-145031703-0","","","English","GIS Proc.

The term ""precision farming"" covers many methods and technologies such as satellite positioning, digital terrain models, soil mapping, yield data and geographic information (GI) systems, which are used in the planning, execution and documentation of site-specific actions (sowing, fertilisation, pesticide, etc.). However, the use of these technologies places an increasing burden of data management on the farmer. Possibilities for the simplification of this data management must therefore be investigated. Because many of the required data are spatially referenced, the modern solutions from the GI-branch are appropriate. The standards-based technologies of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) can automate or avoid many data transfers. In order to optimally apply these technologies, work in the preagro-project has analysed and created prototype implementations of use-cases for an agricultural SDI.","","digital terrain model; GIS; infrastructure; precision agriculture; spatial data","","","","","","","Pedersen S.M., Fountas S., Blackmore B.S., Gylling M., Pedersen J.L., Adoption and perspective of precision farming in Denmark, Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica Section B, Soil and Plant Science, 54, 1, pp. 2-6, (2004); Kitchen N.R., Snyder C.J., Franzen D.W., Wiebold W.J., Educational needs of precision agriculture, Precision Agriculture, 3, 4, pp. 341-351, (2005); Booch G., Rumbaugh J., Jacobson I., Das UML-Benutzerhandbuch, (1999); Seemann J., Wolff von Gudenberg J., Software-Entwurf mit UML, (2000); Stollberg B., Lutz M., Ostlander N., Bernard L., Geoprozessierung in Geodateninfrastrukturen - Aufgaben für die nächste Generation, 10, 2, pp. 22-27, (2007); Spilke J., Zurnstein K., Webservices - Beschreibung eines Ansatzes zur Anwendungskopplung und von Nutzensmöglichkeiten im Agrarbereich, Zeitschrift für Agrarinformatik, 3, 2, pp. 33-40, (2005); Steinberger G., Rothmund M., Martini D., Spietz C., Mallon D., Nash E., Integration von agroXML in eine landwirtschaftliche Geodateninfrastruktur, Landtechnik, 62, 2, pp. 114-115, (2007); Nash E., Kofahl M., Specialist SDIs to support business processes, Proceedings of the 9th AGILE Conference on Geographic Information Science, Visegrád, pp. 72-80, (2006); WCS change request: Support for WSDL & SOAP, Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc, (2005); WMS change request: Support for WSDL & SOAP, Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc, (2005); Egenhofer M., What's special about spatial?: Database requirements for vehicle navigation in geographic space, ACM SIGMOD Record, 22, 2, pp. 398-402, (1993); Tu S., Abdelguerfi M., Web services for geographic information systems, IEEE Internet Computing, 10, 5, pp. 13-15, (2006); Web feature service implementation specification, Open Geospatial Consortium, inc, (2005); Alameh N., Chaining Geographic Information Web Services, IEEE Internet Computing, 10, 5, pp. 22-29, (2006); Whelan B., McBratney A., Definition and interpretation of potential management zones in Australia, Solutions for a better environment: Proceedings of the 11th Australian Agronomy Conference, (2003); Rubin J., Optimal Classification into Groups: An Approach for Solving the Taxonomy Problem, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 15, 1, pp. 103-144, (1967); Reichardt M., Was halten die Landwirte vom präzisen Landbau?, Landtechnik, 62, 1, pp. 28-29, (2007); Schmidt F., Hochgenaue Digitale Geländemodelle - Untersuchungen zur Erstellung, Analyse und Anwendung in der Landwirtschaft, (2003); Heier C., Kiehle C., Automatisierte Liegenschaftsauskunft mittels OGC Web Processing Service, 9, 7, pp. 12-16, (2006); Kiehle C., Greve K., Heier C., Standardized geoprocessing - taking spatial data infrastructures one step further, Proceedings of the 9th AGILE Conference on Geographic information Science, Visegrád, Ungarn, 20.-22.04, (2006); Scholten M., Klamma R., Kiehle C., Evaluating performance in spatial data infrastructures for geoprocessing, IEEE Internet Computing, 10, 5, pp. 34-41; Jager E., Altintas I., Zhang J., Ludascher B., Pennington D., Michener W., A scientific workflow approach to distributed geospatial data processing using web services, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, pp. 87-90, (2005)","E.

This paper describes the basic knowledge and primary principles used in an agricultural environmental information collection device. The device is based on Raspberry Pi, combining with GPS module, some digital sensors and analog sensors to measure environmental temperature and humidity, barometric pressure, light intensity, soil moisture and other environmental information accurate collection. All collected data was real-time transmitted to a remote server specified database for management. In the experiment process, the device has been proved to have the ability to catch the distributed information and also can get different centralized data management. The results show the integration of operational information collection, transmission and management, as well as the use of open source software to make it easy to collect multiple types of data parallelism, which provides an important solution for the rapid transformation of agricultural production. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.","Agricultural environmental information; Integration; Open source; Raspberry Pi","Agriculture; Atmospheric pressure; Integration; Metadata; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Soil moisture; Agricultural productions; Distributed information; Environmental information; Environmental temperature; Information collections; Open sources; Precision Agriculture; Rapid transformations; Information management","","","","","Northwest A&F University of China, (2013BSJJ017, Z109021108); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41401391); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2014YB071, Z109021423)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their critical and constructive review of the manuscript.

It plays an important role in agriculture science and application. However, there is a serious problem about duplicated establishment of MODIS data receive station in China, and it has brought a tremendous waste of money. This paper presents research work on utilizing data grid technology to integrate heterogeneous distributed MODIS data sources. We studied and implemented a three-layer structure for data interoperation, and designed the extensible XML-based spatial data access language to support cross-border data computation. We developed the MODIS data catalogue service to facilitate users and improve system performance. The research helps to release the conflict between duplicated establishment of MODIS receiving station and less effectively data sharing. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","agriculture application; data grid; data service; MODIS","Agriculture; Grid computing; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Technology; Agriculture applications; Agriculture science; Cross-border; Data computation; data grid; Data management system; data service; Data Sharing; Data source; Interoperations; MODIS; Receiving stations; Remote sensing data; Spatial data; Three-layer structures; Information management","","","","","","","MODIS Data Introduction; Dorigo W.A., Zurita-Milla R., De Wit A.J.W., Brazile J., Singh R., Schaepman M.E., A review on reflective remote sensing and data assimilation techniques for enhanced agroecosystem modeling, Intl.

Precision agriculture technologies can be grouped into global positioning systems, sensors, product application controllers, and computer hardware and software. A basic concept of precision agriculture is that appropriate description, recording, and also understanding of spatial and temporal variability allows for precision management of inputs. An understanding of the basis of current agronomic P recommendations is required to fully explore applications of precision agriculture technologies for improving P management. Precision agriculture technologies are useful to describe, understand, and manage variability in plant-available soil P. Moreover, advances in computerized data management systems provide opportunities for more comprehensive data analysis than in the past that should result in improved management decisions. © 2005.

More recently modern science and research methods based on controlled experiments became the most visible instrument of technological change in agriculture, nevertheless farmers continued to develop and implement new technologies based on their own observations made under commercial conditions. Modern information technology and social organization of producers make it possible to use operational research, which is based on the observation and analysis of operations so as to improve them, to manage crops better. The article describes two cases, coffee and sugarcane, in which observation of the results obtained by farmers, with the natural variation in the environment and the distinct management practices they apply can be used to determine site specific crop management practices. The basis of the methodology is to (a) obtain data from a series of cropping events that characterizes the conditions under which each crop is grown, how it is managed and how it performs under commercial conditions (data capture), (b) to manage and analyze the data in centralized databases (data management and analysis) and (c) make the information derived from the data analysis available to growers so that they can use it to make better informed decisions (interpretation). All aspects of the methodology depend on the social organization of the growers and the supply chain of which they form a part, and hence social organization is an integral part of the methodology.The processes of characterization of the growing conditions, including both environmental and management parameters, the establishment of databases, the data analysis and interpretation, and mechanisms of interacting with producers are described with emphasis on the importance of social organization and farmers' groups. Examples are given of how this approach can be used to better understand the crop response to variation in the environment and management, and how this can be used by farmers to improve productivity and quality in two contrasting crops. The paper demonstrates that operational research can be used to evaluate farmers' experiences and to share that knowledge amongst them so as to improve their production practices in the context of their particular environment. It is suggested that the operation research approach is particularly effective in heterogeneous landscapes with perennial crops that have not been the subject of intense research. Furthermore operational research is effective in determining the crop response to variables that are not readily studied in small plots and in determining optimal combinations of multiple variables. Producers believe in the results obtained as there are none of the problems of scaling up from experimental plots to commercial conditions. It is proposed that the approaches described can readily be applied to other crop species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Coffee; Innovation; Operational research; Precision agriculture; Site specific agriculture; Sugarcane","agricultural land; agricultural technology; coffee; crop production; database; innovation; management practice; precision agriculture; sugar cane","","","","","","","Altieri M.A., The science of natural resource management for poor farmers in marginal environments, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 1971, pp. 1-24, (2002); Araya F., Acevedo R., Cabello M.C., Jaramillo C., Gonzalez I., Toro M., Cropcheck Chile:Sistema de Extensión para el Sector Agroalimentario: Versión II, (2010); Atzmanstorfer K., Oberthur T., Laderach P., O'Brien R., Collet L., Quinonez E.G., Probability modelling to reduce decision uncertainty in environmental Niche identification and driving factor analysis: CaNaSTA case studies, Geoinformation for Development - Bridging the Divide through Partnerships, pp. 33-43, (2007); Basso B., Ritchie J.T., Pierce F.J., Braga R.P., Jones J.W., Spatial validation of crop models for precision agriculture, Agricultural Systems, 68, 2, pp. 97-112, (2001); Braun H.J., Rajaram S., van Ginkel M., Breeding for wide adaptation.

In the case under consideration, the organization employs agriculture extension officers who should visit farmers at seven times at key stages during a farming cycle. The city based administrators of the scheme have no way of ensuring that extension officers actually visit the farmers at the appointed times and time intervals. Further, the farmers claims of poor harvests cannot be verified, leading to loan defaults. This project makes use of a multi-language mobile and web application to address these and other challenges faced by the industry in an innovative way. The mobile application can work offline and synchronizes with a cloud database when connectivity is available. The application has been deployed for more than one year.

Further, relying on data to manage ever-larger operations amplifies the risks of bad-data-mediated errors. Growers thus need tools than can integrate the data and transform it into useful information, shifting the data management burden away from the grower and onto the software. Building these tools currently requires knowledge of agricultural operations, as well as integrating with a myriad file formats, APIs, and manufacturer-specific conventions. Data exchange standards can serve many purposes; two are particularly relevant here. First, standards facilitate broader (i.e., more technologies) and more comprehensive (i.e., greater level of detail and precision) systems integration. This is achieved by reducing development and maintenance costs for data handling systems. Second, standards promote reliable system interoperation: standards-compliant tools are expected to work together; the end-user benefits by having confidence that two products from difference sources will work together as expected. The PAIL project chartered by AgGateway (a non-profit consortium dedicated to the implementation of open standards for eAgriculture) seeks to propose an open standard for irrigation data exchange (ASABE Project# X632). This paper provides an overview of PAIL deliverables. We begin by describing PAIL's overall scope. We then provide an overview of: the draft standard's division into parts; a series of business processes; core documents that support them; a set of core concepts (e.g., identity, time, reference, setup and configuration data); the relationships among those concepts; a data exchange schema; and some beta-testing conclusions.

Rao Road, India; Murdeshwar P., Infovet, Thane, India; Hameed Z., National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India","In order to remain globally competitive and to ensure traceability, intensive and extensive livestock operations are adopting radio-frequency-based electronic identification (RFID) and data recording systems. Such integrated systems offer dual advantages of lowered labor costs due to automation and enhanced profits due to optimization of animal productivity, health and welfare. However, RFID-based systems might not be economically viable for small-hold livestock farmers unless there is considerable value advantage. Further, the set up and operation of a data recording system for small-hold farmers is also difficult due to size-constraints and distant farm units. We have developed an integrated system for small-hold dairy farmers to enable employing of RFID technology to ensure credibility of data recording, and avoidance of livestock insurance-related claim malpractices. The system can additionally be used to periodically collect performance records and to operate veterinary service delivery. The integrated system comprises of: (a) an RFID tag or insert; (b) an RFID reader; (c) a PDA/mini-laptop with custom software installed; (d) a USB modem internet connection; and (e) a central data server on web platform with dedicated server-level software. The unique feature of the system is that the veterinary health worker (VHW) is able to register and enter new records only when the RFID reader connected to a mini-laptop is within reading range of the associated RFID tag. This also authenticates the visit by the VHW. Other data management operations such as browsing, sorting, data analysis and report generation can be carried out when the VHW is away from the RFID field. We have deployed and validated the system in a cluster of 5000 dairy animals spread over more than 10 villages with an average of two to three animals per farmer in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India. The system is user-friendly and easy to operate in that the animals' insurance registration and issuance of policy documents can be done in a single farm visit. The system can also be used for collecting periodic animal records and sending SMS 'alerts' to the farmers. Initial economic analysis suggests that the investment cost would be recovered even if fraudulent claims in around 0.5% of the insured animals can be prevented. The sustenance cost can be recovered from the improvised health and production management service delivery to the farmers. It is however emphasized that the system can only be implemented in organized dairy operations wherein the milk processing company can establish functional collaboration with veterinary service providers, insurance company micro-finance companies and this consortium can bear the cost of RFID in exchange for long term multilateral benefits to all the stakeholders. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Animal data networking; Cattle insurance; Dairy animals; Data recording system; RFID; Small-holding dairy farmers","India; Tamil Nadu; Animalia; Bos; Agriculture; Computer software; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Dairies; Data recording; Data reduction; Economic analysis; Employment; Health; Industrial management; Insurance; Integrated control; Integrated optics; Internet; Laptop computers; Profitability; Radio navigation; Recording instruments; Veterinary medicine; Wages; Animal data; Animal data networking; Cattle insurance; Data recording systems; RFID; dairy farming; data acquisition; electronic equipment; information technology; Internet; livestock; rural area; software; technological development; Animals","","","","","World Bank Group, WBG","A part of the development of the herd management software, ‘Herdman-PDA’, was undertaken with financial support from the World Bank, New Delhi, under India Country Development Marketplace Award to the corresponding author.

This paper identifies these challenges posed by the Internet-scale RFlD-based systems. Then we propose a three layered middleware architecture which separates challenges into specific layer. According to the middleware architecture we present a novel middleware framework which comprises double engines named as network management engine and data management engine, respectively. The components of these engines provide the solution to address the challenges faced by RFID middleware. © 2006 IEEE.","","Engines; Inventory control; Large scale systems; Middleware; Network architecture; Network management; Supply chains; Middleware architecture; Middleware frameworks; RFID applications; RFID Middleware; Information management","","","","","","","Schneider M., Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and its applications in the commercial construction industry, Technical Report, (2003); Draft Protocol Specification for a 900MHz Class 0 Radio Frequency Identification Tag, (2003); EPCTm Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-I Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz-960 MHz Version 1.0.9, (2004); RFID for Item Management-Air Interface, Part 6: Parameters for Air Interface Communications at 860 MHz to 960 MHz, (2004); Golding A.R., Rosenbloom P.S., Improving rule-based systems through case-based reasoning, Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 22-27, (1991); Palmer M., Seven Principles of Effective RFID Data Management, (2004); The savant version 0.1, Technical Report, (2002)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies: From Theory to Applications, ICTTA 2006","24 April 2006 through 28 April 2006","Damascus","117880","","0780395212; 978-078039521-3","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Time-based Geographic Information Systems (GISs) allow practitioners to visualize collected data in an intuitive way. However, while current GIS systems have proven to be useful in post hoc analysis and provide simple two-dimensional geographic visualizations, their design typically lacks the features necessary for highly targeted real-time surveillance with the goal of spread prevention. This paper outlines the design, implementation, and usage of a 3D framework for real-time geospatial temporal visualization. In this case study, using livestock movements, the authors show that the framework is capable of tracking and simulating the spread of epidemic diseases. Although the application discussed in this paper relates to livestock disease, the proposed framework can be used to manage and visualize other types of high-dimensional multimedia data as well. © 2013 by IGI Global.

This paper developed an intelligent monitoring system to implement yield information acquisition and displaying based on automatic detection, CAN bus, global satellite positioning (GPS) and GPRS wireless transmission. The grain yield remote monitoring system included two parts: yield monitoring vehicle terminal and remote monitoring unit. The hardware of the yield monitoring vehicle terminal consisted of a microcontroller, a CAN bus communication modules, a DGPS signal module and several sensors connected to the CAN bus modules. The sensors used in system were dual-plate differential impact-based yield sensor, grain moisture sensor, speed sensor, harvesting width sensor, header height sensor, and elevator shaft speed sensor. The software was running on PC with platform of Window CE 7.0, which collected grain flow data, grain moisture, harvester travelling speed and harvesting width data to establish production model and accurately estimate grain yield. Base on GPRS technology, the system could realize remote communication. The data package of yield information could be sent to the data management center of the remote compute (server). After data processing, the remote monitoring unit saved them to a database. Using JSP technology, the server included dynamic interactive Web pages could realize database information query, draw yield map and estimate the yield of any chosen area.","CAN bus; GPRS; Grain yield monitoring system; Precision agriculture; Yield map","Agriculture; Data processing; Information management; Monitoring; Query processing; Remote control; Sensors; CAN bus; GPRS; Grain yield; Precision Agriculture; Yield maps; Grain (agricultural product)","","","","","","","Ma C., Li Y., Xu L., Present Status and Analysis of Grain Flow Sensor of Combine Harvester, Journal of Agricultural Mechanization Research, 7, pp. 74-76, (2008); Chen S., Zhang M., Wang M., Designing and Application of Grain Combine Yield Monitor System, Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery, 36, 1, pp. 97-99, (2005); Wang X., Song Z., An Y., A Remote Real-time Data Collection Monitor and Control System Based on GPRS, Journal of Instrumentation Analysis Monitoring, 1, pp. 23-26, (2005); Hu S., Wan J., Design of GPRS-based groundwater automatic monitoring system, Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering, 42, 1, pp. 89-91, (2011); Wu L., Chen S., Remote data acquisition module Based on the GPRS, Journal of Modern Electronic Technology, 3, pp. 25-28, (2009); Jie Z., Liu H., Hou F., Research advances and prospects of combine on precision agriculture in China, Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 21, 2, pp. 179-182, (2005); Chen S., Hu P., Hu J., Et al., Research and development of one grain yield map generating system, Transactions of the CSAE, 24, 8, pp. 182-184, (2008); Rao J., Tian Z., The design and implementation of CAN bus intelligent node, Journal of Microcomputer Information, 17, 37, pp. 102-104, (2006)","M.

The present study reports a comprehensive comparison of empirical and semi empirical ET0 equations with the corresponding Heuristic Data Driven (HDD) models in a wide range of weather stations in Iran. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) techniques are applied for modeling ET0 values considering different data management scenarios, and compared with corresponding Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Makkink (MK), Priestley-Taylor (PT), and Turc (T) ET0 models as well as their linear and non-linear calibrated versions along with the regression-based Copais algorithm. The obtained results confirm the superiority of GEP-based models. Further, the HDD models generally outperform the applied empirical models. Among the empirical models, the calibrated HS model found to give the most accurate results in all local and pooled scenarios, followed by the Copais and the calibrated PT models. In both local and pooled applications, the calibrated HS equation should be applied when no training data are available for the use of HDD models. The best results of the models correspond to the humid regions, while the arid regions provide the poorest estimates. This may be attributed to higher ET0 values associated with these stations and the high advective component of these locations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","ET<sub>0</sub> models; Heuristic data driven; Iran; Local application; Pooled application","Iran; Arid regions; Calibration; Evapotranspiration; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Gene expression; Hard disk storage; Inference engines; Support vector machines; Accurate estimation; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Comprehensive comparisons; Data driven; Gene expression programming; Iran; Management scenarios; Reference evapotranspiration; comparative study; empirical analysis; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; weather station; Information management","","","","","","","Aghajanloo M.B., Sabziparvar A.A., HosseinzadehTalaee P., Artificial neural network-genetic algorithm for estimation of crop evapotranspiration in a semi-arid region of Iran, Neural Comput.

Kanopolis has a state designated use for municipal and industrial water and supplies 400 million gallons per year to the service area. Its watershed drainage of 2,439 square miles (or two Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 8s), with limited historical characterization, presents problems in determining origination of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS)/sediment, and E. coli bacteria; thus creating the need for extensive water quality monitoring, subwatershed (HUC 12) condition analysis, and Best Management Practices (BMPs) targeting. Monitoring of 41 sites was started in 2007. After 2.5 years, sites were reduced to 31 sites that pinpointed loading and started targeting at the HUC 12 level. The Landon Creek HUC 12 (#102600060401- 35,117 acres, 59% cropland) was targeted in 2009-2010 as analysis indicated Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) impairments and high contributions during storm events. The impairment in overall median water quality was from TN. Yet, the main issue was within storm flow events. Using storm flow means, TN, TP, and TSS values were the highest of all 41 sites. Characterization of subwatersheds is critical to effectively using cost share dollars in order to reduce loading. Building on the monitoring program, we undertook a windshield watershed conditions driving tour using a custom GIS assessment tool, the Western Kansas Cropland Assessment Tool (WKCAT), to spatially characterize subwatersheds by common land units (CLUs). WKCAT was developed to meet the data management and analysis needs of the Big Creek Middle Smoky Hill River Watersheds and is available for download at http://sites.google.com/site/wkcathome/home. With a tablet computer and Arc View 3.3 software, we drove the targeted Landon Creek HUC 12 subwatershed while spatially assessing crop and tillage practices, rangeland conditions, visible erosion, and best management practices. The field conditions were entered in an assessment form and saved in the attribute table of the CLU shapefile. After the data was collected the shapefile was used with GIS software to create cartographs depicting the conditions of the subwatershed and used in conjunction with other geospatial erosion models and equations such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). This assessment method quickly targeted areas in need of load reduction practices such as terraces, waterways, and filter strips. The next step in order to reduce loading is to get the landowners and operators of the Landon Creek HUC 12 together and encourage participation in implementing BMPs. From this group of neighbors, direct decisions will be made on how to best spend demonstration dollars for TMDL reductions within the Landon Creek HUC 12.","Best Management Practice (BMP); Common Land Units (CLU); E. coli bacteria; Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); Impairments; Modeling; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sediment; Subwatershed; Targeting; Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL); Water quality monitoring","Agriculture; Anoxic sediments; Bacteriology; Erosion; Escherichia coli; Geologic models; Information management; Landforms; Loading; Mathematical operators; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rating; Sediment transport; Sedimentology; Soil conservation; Storms; Suspended sediments; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Windshields; Best management practices; Common land units; E. coli; Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); Impairments; Modeling; Subwatershed; Targeting; Total maximum daily load; Water quality monitoring; Reservoirs (water)","","","","","","","Western Kansas Cropland Assessment Tool (WKCAT); Cropland Roadside Transect Survey 2009 Procedures for Using the Cropland Roadside Transect Survey for Obtaining Tillage/Crop Residue Data, (2009)","","","","Mid-Atlantic Water Program; USDA Agricultural Research Service; Am.

In this investigation rainfall-runoff model has been developed based on Kinematic Wave Approximation (KWA) using FEM, Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for overland and channel flow. The FEM technique has been applied to solve the partial differential equation of conservation of mass and conservation of linear momentum governing the hydrologic processes. Remotely sensed data has been used to extract Land Use/Land Cover map of the watershed. Thematic maps have been generated using GIS environment. In this paper, a kinematic wave based distributed watershed model using finite element method, remotely sensed data and geographical information systems based approach is presented for the runoff simulation of Khadakohol watershed. The kinematic wave equations are solved using FEM for overland and channel flow to generate runoff at the outlet of the watershed. Green-Ampt Mein Larson (GAML) model is used for the estimation of infiltration. The GIS has been used to prepare finite element grid and input files such as Manning's roughness and slope. The developed distributed watershed model has been applied to the Khadakohol watershed located in Nashik distrct, Maharashtra state, India. It is observed from the results that, the developed rainfall-runoff model has been found to produce satisfactory results for the data selected for the calibration and validation events of Khadakohol watershed. The simulated results are also compared with observed data. The developed model is useful in generating the hydrographs for agricultural watershed.","Distributed watershed; Finite Element Method; Geographical Information System; Kinematic wave approximation; Rainfall-runoff; Remote Sensing","Agriculture; Channel flow; Computer simulation; Finite element method; Geographic information systems; Information management; Kinematics; Maps; Partial differential equations; Remote sensing; Runoff; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Calibration and validations; Computational technique; Conservation of mass; Data management tools; Developed model; Distributed watershed models; FEM techniques; Finite element grid; Finite element method FEM; Geographical Information System; Geographical information systems; Green-Ampt; Hydrographs; Hydrologic process; Hydrological process; Input files; Kinematic wave approximation; Kinematic wave equation; Kinematic waves; Land use/land cover; Linear momenta; Observed data; Rainfall runoff; Rainfall-runoff modelling; Rainfall-runoff models; Remote sensing and GIS; Remotely sensed data; Runoff simulation; Simulated results; Thematic maps; Watershed modelling; Landforms","","","","","","","Chow V.T., Open-channel Hydraulics, (1959); Chow V.T., Maidment D.R., Mays L.W., Applied Hydrology, (1988); Chu S.T., Infiltration during an unsteady rain, Water Resources Research, 14, 3, pp. 461-466, (1978); Honore G., Project Coordinator, 'Indo German Bilateral Project-watershed Management' Ministry of Agriculture, (2005); Jaywardena A.W., White J.K., A finite element distributed catchment model, II.

Despite recent technological advances in data management and analysis, communications, and remote sensing, monitoring desert locusts and preventing plagues in the years ahead will continue to be a challenge from a geopolitical and financial standpoint for affected countries and the international donor community. We present an overview of the use of remote sensing in desert locust early warning. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","desert locust; early warning; Food and Agriculture Organization; forecasting; geographic information system; plague prevention; remote sensing","Agriculture; Food supply; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Information management; Landforms; desert locust; Early warning; Food and agriculture organizations; International donors; Monitoring system; plague prevention; Preventive control; Technological advances; Remote sensing","","","","","","","Symmons P.M., Cressman K., Biology and behavior, Chapter 1, in Desert Locust Guidelines, (2001); Magor J.I., Et al., Preparedness to Prevent Desert Locust Plagues in the Central Region, An Historical Review (Desert Locust Technical Series AGP/DL/TS/35), (2007); Cherlet M., RAMSES Reconnaissance and Management System of the Environment of Schistocerca (Desert Locust).

The introduction of information technology and automation in farm fields started in the eighties with the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the subsequent development of Precision Agriculture. While being indispensable for many innovative applications, global positioning is not sufficient for all situations encountered in the field, where local sensing is essential if accurate and updated, information has to control automated vehicles. Safeguarding, high resolution mapping, and real time monitoring can only be achieved with local perception sensors such as cameras, lasers, and sonar rangers. However, machine vision offers multiple advantages over other sensing alternatives, and among imaging sensors, stereo vision provides the richest source of information for real time actuation. This chapter presents an overview of current and future applications of 3D stereo vision to off-road intelligent vehicles, with special emphasis in real problems found in agricultural environments and practical solutions devised to cope with them, as image noise, system configuration, and 3D data management. Several examples of stereo perception engines implemented in robotized off-road vehicles illustrate the concepts introduced along the chapter. © 2014, IGI Global.

Although the cost of implementing experiments and collecting data has decreased due to innovative use of geospatial technologies, barriers to making the best farm management decisions based on field experiments remain. The most recent statistics of farmers' adoption and use of yield monitors are reported. Based on theory and experiences from a four-year case study of farmers using yield monitor data, this study reports how the most successful farmers and researchers make use of precision agriculture in their decision-making process. Topics include designing and implementing appropriate field-scale experiments conducive to the landscape and chosen treatments, collecting and managing data, qualities desired by farmers in a reputable spatial data analyst, and using on-farm trial results in the farm management decision-making process. Yield monitor data quality impacts the farm management decision. Typical yield monitor data analysis may use data subjected to a default correction process of farm level software. Recent advances to farm level software include the integration of professional data filtering capabilities. Results from both traditional aspatial and spatial analyses of differing levels of yield data quality are discussed including: 1) accepting default settings from a range of popular standard farm software packages and 2) a conscious removal of erroneous points and flow delay adjustments. The decisions that the rational farm manager would make for each of these scenarios are presented, addressing the question of the economic importance of quality yield data.","Data filtering; Data management; On-farm research; Spatial analysis; Yield monitor data","Computer software selection and evaluation; Data acquisition; Decision making; Decision theory; Experiments; Farms; Data filtering; Data management; On-farm research; Spatial analysis; Yield monitor; Data handling","","","","","","","Anselin L., Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, (1988); Drummond S., Yield Editor 1.02 Beta Version User's Manual, (2006); Griffin T., Adoption of Yield Monitor Technology for Crop Production., (2009); Griffin T., Farmers' Use of Yield Monitors, (2009); Griffin T.W., Decision-Making from On-Farm Experiments: Spatial Analysis of Precision Agriculture Data, (2006); Griffin T.W., Mark T.B., Dobbins C.L., Lowenberg-DeBoer J.M., Whole farm profitability impact from implementing and harvesting on-farm trials with precision agriculture technologies, 17th International Farm Management Congress - Bloomington, 2009, pp. 19-24, (2009); Griffin T.W., In Search of Precision: the Assessment of Arkansas's Early Adopters of Precision Farming and A Economic Analysis of the Profitability of Variable Rate Technology in A Simulated Rice and Soybean Rotation on Arkansas Silt Loam and Clay Soils, (1999); Griffin T.W., Brown J.P., Lowenberg-DeBoer J., Yield Monitor Data Analysis Protocol: A Primer in the Management and Analysis of Precision Agriculture Data., (2007); Griffin T.W., Dobbins C.L., Vyn T., Florax R.J.G.M., Lowenberg-DeBoer J., Spatial analysis of yield monitor data: Case studies of on-farm trials and farm management decision-making, Precision Agriculture, 9, 5, pp. 269-283, (2008); Griffin T.W., Lambert D.M., Teaching interpretation of yield monitor data analysis: Lessons learned from Purdue's 37th top farmer crop workshop, Journal of Extension [On-line], 43, 3, (2005); Griffin T.W., Lowenberg-DeBoer J., Lambert D.M., Peone J., Payne T., Daberkow S.G., Adoption, Profitability, and Making Better Use of Precision Farming Data, (2004); Lambert D.M., Lowenberg-Deboer J., Bongiovanni R., A comparison of four spatial regression models for yield monitor data: A case study from Argentina, Precision Agriculture, 5, 6, pp. 579-600, (2004); Nistor A., Florax R.J.G.M., Farmers and Consultants Receive Training in Spatial Analysis of Yield Monitor Data, (2007); Popp J., Griffin T.W., Pendergrass E., How cooperation may lead to consensus assessing the realities and perceptions of precision farming in your state, Journal of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, 65, 1, pp. 26-31, (2002); R: A language and environment for statistical computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, (2009); Urcola H., Economic Value Added by Yield Monitor Data from the Producer's Own Farm in Choosing Hybrids and Varieties., (2003); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2003)","T.

However, it is challenging because it relies on (1) massive modeling-related, geographically distributed, terabyte, or even petabyte scale data sets (geoscience and engineering data), (2) needs to rapidly perform hundreds or thousands of flow simulations, being Identical runs with different models calculating the impacts of various uncertainty factors, (3) an integrated, secure, and easy-to-use problem-solving toolkit to assist uncertainty analysis. We leverage Grid computing technologies to address these challenges. We design and implement an integrated problem-solving environment ResGrid to effectively improve reservoir uncertainty analysis. The ResGrid consists of data management, execution management, and a Grid portal. Data Grid tools, such as metadata, replica, and transfer services, are used to meet massive size and geographically distributed characteristics of data sets. Workflow, task farming, and resource allocation are used to support large-scale computation. A Grid portal integrates the data management and the computation solution into a unified easy-to-use interface, enabling reservoir engineers to specify uncertainty factors of interest and perform large-scale reservoir studies through a web browser. The ResGrid has been used in petroleum engineering.

Agrarwiss./L., 49090 Oldenburg, Oldenburger Landstr. 24, Germany","The use of electronic identification (EID) in cattle husbandry will get more and more importance because of the enormous structural change in agriculture and the related automatisation. It is expected to be established as a basic technology for the relation of automatically recorded sensor-data to an individual animal. With the continuous development of microelectronic components, the avaibility and use of sensors in agriculture will increase, too. This will lead to a cheaper measurement of direct and indirect health parameters such as: body temperature, animal activity, animal weight, milk yield, conductivity of milk, intake of concentrate and rouphage, behavioural aspects etc. Biological processes are very complex in most cases and they are influenced by interacting external effects. As a consequence sensor-based data should not be interpreted as a single parameter, but need to be seen in a whole context. In order to derive any decision, special and expert knowledge is required to calculate and to analyse the available data from different sensors in an adequate way. Further developments of hard- and software will not stop with an accurate description of the ""status quo"". It is rather expected, that predicting information systems will be developed. First steps can be seen by investigations of ""neural nets"", ""fuzzi logic"" and ""data mining""-processes. The increasing availability and the use of internet applications in agriculture support new methods of collecting and processing data. Besides the use of data on local, decentral farm computers it is possible to transfer them to a central, data-management-plattform, with defined access for the farmer (and other user groups such as consultants or veterinarians). It remains open whether this technique can be established in future.","","Automation; Data acquisition; Data processing; Health care; Microelectronic processing; Neural networks; Sensors; Behavioural aspects; Cattles; Data management platform; Electronic identification; Agriculture","","","","","","","Artmann R., Automatische datenerfassung von landwirtschaftlichen nutztieren, Messsysteme für Tierdaten Und Ihre Bedeutung für das Herdenmanagement von Milchviehbetrieben.

The growth in mobile has surpassed internet due to cost effectiveness. Mobile as a tool holds promise for facilitating access of agricultural information by majority of the farmers. Its promotion has already been started by a few organizations, but mostly in supply mode. Hence, it was decided to develop the SMS based solution that works in demand mode. The solution consists of server stub and client stub. The server stub is a group of applications that receive surrogated query from client component in asynchronous mode and deliver desired information in flawless, efficient and uninterrupted manner. The server stub consists of message process, query process, database and analytical process. Client stub is a single application that is installed in user's mobile. The major functionalities of the client stub are: presentation and navigation, data management and message processing. In the implemented solution, total number of decision points and lists are 495 and 130 respectively. In list total number of elements varies from 2 to 15. The user selects information node from the list as per requirement. After selection of terminal node, message processing layer generates surrogated query which on confirmation is forwarded to Application Service Provider (ASP) end for processing. The solution has been developed for agriculture domain with crop, fertilizer, water management, crop protection, weather and agricultural implements as primary information area. © 2015 IEEE.","Agricultural information; Client Stub; Server Stub; SMS; Surrogated Query","Agricultural implements; Agricultural robots; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Information management; Samarium; Water management; Agricultural informations; Analytical process; Application service provider; Asynchronous modes; Client Stub; Information nodes; Message processing; Surrogated Query; Query processing","","","","","","","Mashelkar R.A., Making technologies work for the poor, Employment News, 24, 25, (2004); Wood-Harper A.T., Corder S., Wood I.R.G., Watson H., How we profess: The ethical systems analyst, Commun ACM, 39, 3, pp. 69-77, (1996); Collins W.R., Miller K.W., Spielman B.J., Wherry P., How good is good enough?

One of the most demanding functions is data acquisition. Mobile farm equipment featuring different sensors is able to collect a large amount of data while working. Automated process-data acquisition can be the basis for information-steered agricultural production. But use of these data is restricted today by hardware and software compatibility, different data formats, the lack of a concept for reusing data, and the amount of data. This paper presents a prototype implementation of an agricultural process-data service (APDS). It is part of an infrastructure for data management in information-driven plant production, developed in the Pre agro joint research project. Data are recorded in an ISOBUS environment and transferred to a server. There they are analyzed and aggregated to jobs.

Therefore, a special design of microcomputer boards for sensor networks is required to develop practical agricultural sensor network systems. This paper proposes a new type of sensor network system for agricultural usages. The system consists of a new developed microcomputer board, a special smartphone application for data collection, and a data management server. The developed microcomputer board has special functions for a charging function from a solar cell to a lithium polymer battery, a large-current regulator for external electronic components, a capacitor for power supply stability, real-time clock (RTC), a power management for external sensors, a SD card support, and a communication function based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The special application supports BLE communication, which is a wireless personal area network technology for low-power communication. It also collects the measurement infor-mation from a developed microcomputer board within BLE communication range, and uploads the collected measurement information to the data management server.

Since no two farms are the same with respect to information and management structure, a specialized farm management information system (FMIS) which is tailored to the realities on the ground of individual farms is likely to be more effective than generalized FMIS available today. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel distributed set of open-source, collaborative mobile apps known as Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK). OpenATK endeavors to provide such a specialized FMIS solution by incorporating low-cost, widely available mobile computing technologies, internet-based cloud storage services, and user-centered design principles.","Cloud storage; Data management; Distributed data model; Mobile apps; Usability","Farms; Management information systems; Cloud storage services; Cloud storages; Design and implementations; Distributed data; Mobile apps; Mobile computing technology; Production agriculture; Usability; Information management","","","","","","","Ault A., Krogmeier J., Buckmaster D., Mobile, Cloud-Based Farm Management: A Case Study with Trello on My Farm, 2013 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

Chase Hall, Lincoln, 68583, NE, United States","There has been a growing trend in public and private groups focusing on data utilization in agricultural settings in the U.S. over the past five years. This information, typically referred to as Precision Agriculture (PA) data, has advanced from field collected data (e.g., yield and soil samples) to data that many producers may never see. Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus is one example of data rarely perceived by those operating field machinery; however it is crucial to the machine functionality. This information is becoming more widely used by groups (manufacturers, dealerships, and data management companies) seeking to utilize these data for realtime applications including machine diagnostics, machine health monitoring, and field efficiency estimations. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J1939 standard messages utilized by the machine CAN Bus have theoretical values, however little work has been done to verify these values. For example, fuel flow rate values reported are rarely measured directly on field equipment using a flow meter, and must be therefore estimated based on other operating parameters. The goal of this study was to compare data collected from the CAN Bus to measured values from tests conducted at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL), an approved OECD Test Station to provide an indication of accuracy among the measured values. A National Instruments LabView program was written to simultaneously log CAN Bus messages along with the NTTL test data. Selected parameters from the SAE J1939 message data base were then compared with actual steady-state values measured during testing. Results from this study will provided needed information regarding the accuracy of certain messages being passed on the CAN Bus. This will give end users the ability to assess potential errors that may exist when the CAN Bus is utilized as a data source for further analysis during real-life scenarios of machine utilization. As initial results indicate, the CAN based fuel rate is measured higher than actual fuel rate, so more data collection will be required to find the correlation to aid in a more accurate assessment of in field efficiency measured via CAN bus.","Accuracy; Acquisition; Agricultural machinery; CAN bus; Controller Area Network; Embedded systems; J1939","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Aircraft engines; Automobile testing; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Embedded systems; Flowmeters; Fuels; Information management; Process control; Software testing; Testing; Tractors (truck); Accuracy; Acquisition; CAN bus; Controller area network; J1939; Soil surveys","","","","","","","Auernhammer H., Speckmann H., Communication issues and internet use, CIGR Handbook of Agricultural Engineering Volume VI: Information Technology, (2000); DLG E.V. - Test Center Technology & Farm Inputs, (2014); Russo J., Big Data & Precision Agriculture, (2013); Cupera J., Sedlak P., The use of CAN-bus messages of an agricultural tractor for monitoring its operation, Res.

The exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern data sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also poses a number of common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or ""data farming""), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases, interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition, visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science, scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century. © 2005 IEEE.","Astronomy; Data management; Information technology; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge representation; Scientific visualization","Astronomy; Computational complexity; Computer science; Electronic commerce; Learning systems; Security of data; Virtual reality; Automated clustering; Science-driven computing; Virtual astronomy; Information technology","","","","","Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS, (0101360, 0122449, 0326524, 0407448)","","Szalay A., Gray J., The world-wide telescope, Science, 293, pp. 2037-2040, (2001); Brunner R., Djorgovski S.G., Prince T., Szalay A., Massive data sets in astronomy, Handbook of Massive Data Sets, pp. 931-979, (2002); McKee C., Taylor J., Et al., Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium, National Academy of Science, (2000); U.S. NVO white paper, Toward A National Virtual Observatory: Science Goals, Technical Challenges, and Implementation Plan, (2001); Brunner R., Djorgovski S.G., Szalay A., Virtual Observatories of the Future, 225, (2001); The National Virtual Observatory Science Definition Team Report; Banday A., Et al., Mining the Sky, (2001); Quinn P., Gorski K., Toward An International Virtual Observatory, (2004); Djorgovski S.G., Et al., Exploration of parameter spaces in a virtual observatory, Astronomical Data Analysis, (2001); Djorgovski S.G., Et al., Searches for rare and new types of objects, Virtual Observatories of the Future, (2001); Djorgovski S.G., Et al., Exploration of large digital sky surveys, Mining the Sky, (2001); Djorgovski S.G., Et al., Challenges for cluster analysis in a virtual observatory, Statistical Challenges in Astronomy III, (2002); Babu G.J., Djorgovski S.G., Some statistical and computational challenges, and opportunities in astronomy, Statistical Science, 19, (2004); Odewahn S.C., Et al., Automated star/galaxy discrimination with neural networks, Astron.

The spatial data from the soil survey were organized using a geographic information system (GIS) to facilitate storage, management, and analysis. In the first stage, the available data for the study were collected, digitized, and processed (maps, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs). Based on this information, many other derivative data layers such as slope, curvature, and slope aspect were manipulated. Sampling points were determined with GIS, while the exact position of each sampling was recorded using a global positioning system (GPS). This information, along with results pertaining to the sample, was entered into the graphical database, which was specially designed to store all the relevant data of the sampled points. Data layers describing the spatial distribution of key parameters such as soil texture, pH, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and nutrient status were produced. The use of GIS was very helpful for soil classification and evaluation of soil suitability for a range of activities, whereas the visualization of the data collected and the derived results in the form of various thematic maps demonstrated the ability of GIS to act as a valuable administrative tool and, in addition, to provide substantial valuable support to farmers in improving the applied farming practices.

The objective of the study was to produce a reliable and cost-effective hardware and software system for measuring six key environmental variables. The main components of the ""BASE-Q"" system are the two measurement boxes containing the sensors; the internet-based PC and pocket PC-based softwares; and the Users' Manual detailing recommended monitoring procedures. The first BASE-Q box contains sensors for measuring air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), the concentrations of ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) up to 10-30 days depending on the logging interval. The second contains a vacuum pump and Venturi tubes and is used to measure concentrations of inhalable and respirable particles gravimetrically over an 8- to 10-h period. Engineering characteristics of the buildings are recorded on site and the collected data stored and processed by the internet or PC-based BASE-Q program. The program automatically calculates the concentrations and emission rates of the different airborne pollutants from individual buildings by using prediction models developed during related studies as a pre-screening exercise before actual measurements are undertaken. The size and weight of the monitoring hardware have been markedly reduced to improve ease of installation and transport. The monitoring equipment has been simplified and waterproofed to improve ease of deployment and disinfection. The special software has greatly simplified data management and reporting. These improvements have reduced the labor input required for operating the system and thus minimized the cost of AQ monitoring. This will enable producers and consultants to measure AQ routinely on farms, reducing worker OH&S risks, improving environmental outcomes, and potentially improving production efficiency. © 2009 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Air pollution; Ammonia; Bacteria; Dust; Farm building; Microorganisms; Particles","Bacteria (microorganisms); Agriculture; Air quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric humidity; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Carbon dioxide; Dust; Exposure controls; Farm buildings; Humidity control; Internet; Occupational risks; Pollution; Sensors; Air quality monitoring; Air temperatures; Airborne pollutants; Australia; Building environments; Data managements; Emission rates; Engineering characteristics; Environmental assessments; Environmental monitoring; Environmental outcomes; Environmental variables; Hardware and softwares; Internet-based; Livestock buildings; Measure concentrations; Monitoring equipments; Monitoring hardwares; Particles; Pc-Based; Pocket-PC; Pollutant emissions; Prediction models; Production efficiencies; Relative humidities; Respirable particles; Venturi tubes; Monitoring","","","","","","","Agranovski I.E., Agranovski V., Reponen T., Willeke K., Grinshpun S.A., Development and evaluation of a new personal sampler for culturable airborne microorganisms, Atmospheric Environment, 36, 5, pp. 889-898, (2002); Agranovski V., Ristovski Z., Blackall P.J., Morawska L., Size-selective assessment of airborne particles in swine confinement building with the UVAPS, Atmospheric Environment, 38, 23, pp. 3893-3901, (2004); Banhazi T., Building Assessment System for Environmental Quality - project final report and User's Manual Australian Pork Limited Final, (2005); Banhazi T., Dunn M., Cook P., Black J., Durack M., Johnnson I., Development of precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies for the Australian pig industry, 3rd European Precision Livestock Farming Conference, pp. 219-228, (2007); Banhazi T., Rutley D., Pitchford W., Summary and model validation of a large statistical study of airborne pollutants in Australian piggery buildings, SEAg 2007, pp. 89-97, (2007); Banhazi T.M., Rutley D.L., Pitchford W.S., Identification of risk factors for sub-optimal housing conditions in Australian piggeries - Part IV: Emission factors and study recommendations, J. of Agricultural Safety and Health, 14, 1, pp. 53-69, (2008); Banhazi T.M., Seedorf J., Rutley D.L., Pitchford W.S., Identification of risk factors for sub-optimal housing conditions in Australian piggeries - Part I: Study justification and design, J. of Agricultural Safety and Health, 14, 1, pp. 5-20, (2008); Banhazi T.M., Seedorf J., Rutley D.L., Pitchford W.S., Identification of risk factors for sub-optimal housing conditions in Australian piggeries - Part II: Airborne pollutants, J. of Agricultural Safety and Health, 14, 1, pp. 21-39, (2008); Banhazi T.M., Seedorf J., Rutley D.L., Pitchford W.S., Identification of risk factors for sub-optimal housing conditions in Australian piggeries - Part III: Environmental parameters, J. of Agricultural Safety and Health, 14, 1, pp. 41-52, (2008); Groot Koerkamp P.W.G., Metz J.H.M., Uenk G.H., Phillips V.R., Holden M.R., Sneath R.W., Short J.L., White R.P., Hartung J., Seedorf J., Schroder M., Linkert K.H., Pedersen S., Takai H., Johnsen J.O., Wathes C.M., Concentrations and Emissions of Ammonia in Livestock Buildings in Northern Europe, J. of Agricultural Engineering Research, 70, 1, pp. 79-95, (1998); Hand J.L., Kreidenweis S.M., Kreisberg N., Hering S., Stolzenburg M., Dick W., McMurry P.H., Comparisons of aerosol properties measured by impactors and light scattering from individual particles: Refractive index, number and volume concentrations, and size distributions, Atmospheric Environment, 36, 11, pp. 1853-1861, (2002); Jones W., Morring K., Morey P., Sorenson W., Evaluation of the Anderson viable impactor for single stage sampling, American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, 46, 5, pp. 294-298, (1985); Kerker M., Light scattering instrumentation for aerosol studies: An historical overview, Aerosol Science and Technology, 27, 4, pp. 522-540, (1997); Liang Y., Xin H., Wheeler E.F., Gates R.S., Zajaczkowski J.S., Topper P., Li H., Casey K.D., Ammonia emissions from U.S. laying hen houses in Iowa and Pennsylvania, Trans.

The goal of this paper is to model vine vigor level according to the most influential variables. The approach was based upon a collected dataset in a French vineyard in the middle Loire valley and the available expert knowledge. The input features were related to soil, rootstock and inter-crop management, the output was an expert assessment of vine plot vigor. The approach included a data selection step, which was needed because of data imperfection and incompleteness. Usually implicit in the literature, data selection was carried out with explicit criteria. Then a fuzzy model was designed from the selected data. Owing to the fuzzy model interpretability, its structure and behavior were analyzed. Results showed that, despite the data imperfection, the approach was able to select data that yielded an informative model. Well-known relationships were identified, and some elements of new or controversial knowledge were discussed. This is an important step towards the design of a decision support tool aiming to adapt the agricultural practices to the environment in order to get a given vigor level. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic learning; Data inconsistency; Data selection; Fuzzy logic; Hidden variables; Knowledge imprecision","France; Loire Valley; Agronomy; Decision support systems; Fuzzy logic; Automatic-learning; Data inconsistencies; Data Selection; Hidden variable; Knowledge imprecision; agricultural practice; agronomy; automation; data management; environmental factor; fuzzy mathematics; knowledge; precision agriculture; rootstock; vigor; vineyard; Data reduction","","","","","INRA-SAD’ department and Pays de la Loire Region","This work is part of a PhD project that aims to study the combined effects of environmental factors and agricultural practices and link them with wine quality.

There is no comprehensive knowledge of existing data at the meso- and microscale in China. In the context of a specific research programme of several years' duration in China, as a side-effect of data acquisition information could be gathered on the availability of such data. Whereas micro-level data are not accessible due to data policy, there is a chance for international cooperation projects to obtain and work with data on topography, soils, land use, climate and socio-economic issues at the in meso-scale in China itself.","Agriculture; China; Climate; Data; GIS; Land use; Soil; Topography; Weather","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; data management; GIS; land use; topography","","","","","","","Albertz J., Einführung in Die Fernerkundung, (2001); Bareth G., Disaggregierung Der Bodenübersichtskarte 1:200 000 Anhand Einer Reliefanalyse Des DHM50, 12, pp. 33-40, (2001); Bareth G., Using IKONOS high resolution remote sensing data for land use classification in China, Proc.

VEG organizes and provides coherence to a diverse set of techniques and tools that are used by these scientists. It codifies in knowledge-based system components, heuristic knowledge used by these scientists when doing scientific work. The VEG system saves the scientist many hours of laborious calculation, and it empowers the scientist by allowing him or her to work quickly at a higher level of abstraction without the need to focus attention on a multitude of low-level tasks.

Therefore, developers of DSSs have had some difficulties in constructing DSSs which could be widely used. In the first part of this two-part paper series, a conceptual framework was introduced which proposes methods for making DSSs transportable. This framework serves as a checklist and includes recommendations about general implementation, user interaction, data management, and model aspects. To illustrate the implementation of these recommendations, the development of a DSS within a project called SYBIL is discussed in detail. Therein, portable and public domain tools have been used to build the DSS with a graphical user interface (GUI) which satisfies the general implementation aspects of the framework. Further, the development of a flexible data management system has been essential in the project so that different types of data can be easily handled without changing the models. In order to allow models embedded within the DSS to be successfully transported between regions, a novel artificial intelligence (AI) adaptation methodology was implemented. The main component of this adaptation methodology is a genetic algorithm (GA), an AI search technique. By linking a GA to an agricultural model, the model becomes more robust because the model is able to adapt to the region in which it is being used. Overall, by using the framework criteria to select/create these tools/components, the DSS has been made easy to transport and disseminate.","Adaptation; Decision support system; Genetic algorithm; Modeling; Portability","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Computer software portability; Genetic algorithms; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Information management; Adaptation; Agricultural decision support systems; Decision support systems","","","","","European Commission, EC","Funding has been provided for the SYBIL project (project number PL 900615) by the EC CAMAR Program (Competitiveness in Agriculture).

For precision agriculture, the focus of the research is to develop the expertise to utilize this imagery to facilitate management decisions at the farm level. Decision making at the farm level requires high spatial resolution imagery (on the order of 1 meter or less) in order to develop prescriptions for nutrient supplements, integrated pest management (insects, weeds), irrigation, and to serve as a harvesting aid. This degree of analysis of the plant and soil also requires that higher spectral resolution be available to ascertain the nuances in the target vegetation's reflectance and to be able to relate this to specific agricultural problems. In addition, decisions at the farm level must be made within a few days of onset of a problem. Therefore, revisit frequencies for precision agriculture are on the order of 10-14 days. The requirement for high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution imagery creates special image processing and analysis challenges. These include - data management, geometric & radiometric corrections, ground control points & georeferencing, and data analysis via such approaches as data fusion. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to illustrate the diversity of high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution imagery required for precision agriculture applications. Second, to offer the opportunity to other data fusion researchers to join the author of this paper in developing new data fusion techniques for high-resolution imagery.","","Agriculture; Decision making; Environmental engineering; Forestry; Image sensors; Plants (botany); Sensor data fusion; Soils; Vegetation; High-resolution imagery; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","","2000 Internaitonal Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2000)","24 July 2000 through 28 July 2000","Honolulu, HI, USA","57641","","","IGRSE","","English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034539765"

New technologies have advanced our ability to address these issues but the solutions may require the commitment of resources that may yet be outside the reach of developing countries. This paper briefly reviews new and existing technologies in the areas of data collection methods with some emphasis on remote sensing methods. An example for a conceptual data base management system adapted by the US Department of Agriculture is presented as a framework for the acquisition, maintenance and distribution of climate and agrometeorological data for the 21st century. The access of data to the national and international community can be resolved with the standardization of data base management and electronic accessibility. Databases in the US have been upgraded for access through the World Wide Web, and include data archived from other countries that have co-operative programs with US institutions. The operational needs of national agricultural producers, researchers, and agricultural weather and crop forecasters are the focus of this paper although it also serves some of the needs of the international research community.

To assist, a conceptual framework is introduced which proposes methods for making DSSs transportable so that their utility is high. This framework serves as a checklist and includes recommendations about general implementation, user interaction, data management, and models. General implementation aspects emphasize portable and public domain tools, and user interaction aspects the use of a graphical user interface (GUI); flexible data management systems play a large role in satisfying the suggested data management aspects; and an intelligent model adaptation strategy is one of the main model aspect recommendations.","Data management; Decision support system; Modeling; Portability; User interface","Agriculture; Computer hardware; Computer simulation; Computer software portability; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Information management; Agricultural decision support systems; Data management; Decision support systems","","","","","European Commission, EC","This work has been performed under a project called SYBIL.

This paper describes a new approach to a complex spatial assignment problem that has resisted traditional optimization techniques. The many diverse quantitative and qualitative objectives underlying agricultural land consolidation are enumerated and formalized. The design of an interactive multiple objective solution approach that takes advantage of the visualization and data management capabilities of commercially available GIS is explained.

Management strategies incorporating remote sensing, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and variable rate treatment (VRT) offer the possibility of positioning inputs exactly in order to optimize farm returns and minimize chemical inputs and environmental hazards. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) is essential for such a management paradigm. This paper introduces the concept of precision farming and discusses the role of GIS as a centralized data management and analysis tool. Results from a survey of the use of GIS in precision farming are included in order to determine strengths and weaknesses of the technology and to provide impetus for improvements in GIS to support agricultural applications. -Authors","","farming data management; GIS; GPS; variable rate treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029530086"

The Canada Soil Information System (CanSIS), developed by Agriculture Canada, has allowed for the capture of spatial data in computer-readable format (both digitized line information and keyed text data) and has provided data management, manipulation, analysis and output capabilities. In recent years, soil surveyors and other users of CanSIS have become aware that other Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offered features which they required but which CanSIS did not provide. A review of commercially available GIS's provided adequate information to confirm their functional capabilities but not the computer capacity requirements in terms relevant to the Agriculture Canada application. This article explains how the computer capacity requirements were measured and used to develop specifications of a suitable system. The methodology is not restricted to GIS applications but can be used to determine the capacity needs of other software packages. © 1989.","","Agricultural Engineering--Canada; Computer Operating Systems--Storage Allocation; Computer Software; Geographic Information System; Maps and Mapping","","","","","","","American Farmland Trust, Survey of geographic information systems for natural resources decision making at the local level, (1985); Dumanski, Kloosterman, Brandon, Concepts objectives and structure of the Canada Soil Information System, Canadian Journal of Soil Science, 55, pp. 181-187, (1975); Henkel, Hardware roundup, Computerworld, 19, 33, pp. 23-34, (1985); Tomlinson, Geographic information systems — a new frontier, Proc.
